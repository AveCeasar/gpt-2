Nightfall too dark / to read the page, / Too cold
the way she is now: / twenty-three years and I know people / change, but she changed / from jalapeños and tequila / to homegrown jasmine / and touches of black pepper without / asking me to taste her.
Groaning fingers stretch out  / striving to reach obsolescence in the / form of a landline home phone.
the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning / is the faint glimmer of hope that things will be better today / and that i will not be anxious
Full moon / Pine tree / Old house
The moment you confided in me, my beautiful friend / The truth broke me in half, and now it has to end / And as I sit in my room with the indigo walls / The lights are off and this ginger ale tastes / like nothing at all.
Time keeps running out / sweat / On my brow, from playing
I’m not a poet. The beer is. / The beer is typing. The beer has / written and deleted six poems tonight. / The beer is cheap. I bought it at  / a rural gas station coming back
I still worry about how I look my dry white hair oh / age wanting to fuck but I'll sing no matter how things are
Like you are brain-stuck  / vaporous / Rapidly expanding / Pushing out the indents in your skull?
Nights  / have lost their glow.
poems should come from bare ground / night falling on night falling on a black landscape
If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him if it was hard to condemn his son to death to absolve our sins only to have the world end up like this / I'd ask him, from father to son why some kids have to grow up without parents that love them
Lin-chi’s followers don’t know Zen I the Blind Donkey do / my tongue and gentle fingers thick hard cock / one autumn night’s a thousand centuries
The barking dog / Kill him / With a bicycle wheel
Spring night / a leaf falling / From my chimney
The creamer gives, / the groaner quakes / the angel smiles
Train on the horizon / my window / rattles
November’s New Haven / baggagemaster stiffly / Disregards my glance
Aurora Borealis / over the Hozomeen – / The void is stiller
why was the radio playing Summertime Sadness  / why does the ER have a radio  / what was the point of buying that sweater  / why do you still wear it  / do you think it will fit over your cast  / did they give you a choice on the color  / isn't there enough purple in there
anybody can enter Buddha's world / so few can step into the Devil's
no nothing only those wintry crows / bright black in the sun
Now I'm reaching out for answers  / From a boy inside a box / Who couldn't reach the record  / And could only see the stop.
Tonight I'll lower / my tail / I've seen them around town
and he still has some months to go? / i like crabs / crabs are nice
The new moon / is the toe nail / Of God
Wild to sit on a haypile, / Writing Haikus, / Drinkin wine
The cat: a little / body being used / By a little person
Birds chirp / fog / Bugs the gate
How many cigarettes are you  / Smoking / To numb the buzzing behind / Your eyes?
in different headwraps and ways of weaving floormats and bathroom habits / but at the end of every day / All everyone wants is a hot meal a good fuck a stiff drink and a cuddle
Gary Snyder / is a haiku / far away
The click of the receiver  / sounds like a click. / The grimace is an approximate / impression of a smile.
After the shower / the red roses / In the green, green
nature's a killer I won't sing to it / I hold my breath and listen to the dead singing under the grass
"i have breasts, see"  / "did you see my breasts"  / "p.s. i have breasts lol"  / "did you see them"  / "guys"  / "did you"
I can't smell a thing can't see their pink / but they'll find branches next spring
whilst wading my inner sanctum  / silver glisten of a hooked dream  / there’s a whale to redeem
I said it but I don't believe it / How could I really want to die / We all have pain inside but everyone else seems to get by / Why can't I
I'd ask him to bring back Michael Jackson because the world needs something to smile at / I'd ask him to make sure Beyoncé never dies because we need someone to look up to and apparently, its not you / If I had God's phone number
I'm alive! right? don't we say that? / we don't see the bones we walk on
The birds start singing / but he is in the cat meadows
Forever and forever / everything’s alright / midnight woods
Gary gone from the shack / like smoke / My lonely shoes
If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him "where are you?" / Because things aren't too good down here and I think we may need some divine intervention
America: fishing licenses / the license / To meditate
inside the koan clear mind / gashes the great darkness
Night – six petals / have fallen from / Bodhidharma’s bouquet
I wonder How they've been? / Sick / Older / Surrounded by family and friends. / Except one. / The kids are looking through your old photos with you. / Who is that? / You read the obituaries. / You almost forgot they existed. / I guess they don't anymore. / You cry at the funeral. / The kids had to ask. / Who was that?
White clouds of this steamy planet / obstruct / My vision of the blue void
Greyhound bus, / flowing all night, / Virginia
I found hell in a gas station in the humdrum slums of farmland California; / In the eyes of the wretched gatekeepers living in the neon hope of the gas prices; / The town of twenty trapped by tilled trenches tasked with too much time;
A big fat flake / of snow / Falling all alone
In London-town cats / can sleep / In the butcher's doorway.
Rig rig rig / that’s the rat / On the roof
Stop slipping me / Your old Diamond Sutra / You illimitable tight-ass!
To a drive and desire  / for things so true; / Compassion and love  / I feel for you - / All.
Autumn nite / the boys / playing haiku.
The raindrops have plenty / of personality / Each one
The sunset is caramel dripping down the buildings / And I am willing to bet / That the grass smells nothing like your fingers catching on my cheek when you pinned me down / On the mossy clover hill behind the church last summer.
Lonesome blubbers / grinding out the decades / with wet lips
Perfect circle round / the moon / In the center of the sky
some die meditating some on their feet but he did both / not black not white that old man P’u-K’o / like a distant bird barely audible
but no one spooned like  / rob  / and no one blew like  / fahad  / and the pill blake gave me put me right in the  / mood
Jack reads his book / aloud at nite / the stars come out.
Sometimes when I get too stoned / and I don’t trust myself to remember things / I’ll text them to myself
go down on your silly knees pray / for what? tomorrow is yesterday
Mao Tse Tung has taken / too many Siberian sacred / Mushrooms in Autumn
We have no earthy connection, patriotism -  / no mysterious world to explore.
“Yes. A spider. Of unreasonable size  / yes. I tell you, Matilda, you let these  / little fuckers crawl around and they / think they own the place.”
"I promise, fox, you'll walk with me. / For in our time I came to see / That kindred souls will 'oft ensure / Their paths will intertwine once more / It won't be long I promise dear." / So loved the fox and I.
at the bath she bathed scrubbing her face and body / at the bath I splashed water on myself enjoying her body
which is why I think it’s so special that  / upon first laying my eyes on you  / I felt that infinitude: / that boundless untick tock
Change Su Chi’s art / studio, a silent / Shade in the window
Step gingerly, one foot at a time  / out of the shower-bath and wrap  / a lone giant fluffy pink towel  / around myself. Steam drifts slowly  / from my body like 8 grams of soul  / departing.
shut the circuit off / rearranged the wires / i wanted to / start over
The clouds are / following each other / Into Eternity
What passes through / is amusing / Himself being dew
And I  / The boyfriend  / Write this poem.
Love for Flag, God and Country  / To thee, I pledge. / Great like soda fountains  / And Drive-Thru movies
There's no need to search  / So stop worrying too.  / Just open your heart  / And let love find you.
Neath a velvet black sea  / And deep in a silence unbroken by all  / We watched as the stars were beginning to fall.
and then there was erica and charlize  / and and  / and that creepy mustache man  / twice my age  / and also those two guys  / at the same time.
But when we’re in his bed / and he turns away from me  / instead of sleeping  / I connect the freckles on his back  / creating constellations / out of tiny brown birthmarks.
There is a huge broccoli / Next to my stuff / In the refrigerator
Temple trees / across the creek / Fog blowing
Chipmunk went in / butterfly / Came out
Poor gentle flesh / there is / No answer
Shall I heed God’s commandment? / wave breaking / On the rocks -
and he stuck it in my butt  / and i wished  / it was a cucumber  / and – god!
I cannot hold it together anymore. / I've never felt this depressed ever. / The worst I've ever felt. / Perhaps it's time for something drastic.
one long pure beautiful road of pain / and the beauty of death and no pain
Everywhere beyond / the Truth, / Empty space blue
The bones in her hands shifted / as she fixed her hair into a ponytail. / "You're going to promise me that  / you're not going to try to fix me. / You're going to promise me, okay?" / And so I did.
You hugged that tree closer than any lover / a tangle of limbs and dripping sweat  / rough hands grasping at the hard knots and taut sinews / of twisting bodies.
And thinks of me
At a Coney Island / hamburger / In Vancouver Washington
A current pimple / In the mind’s / Old man
Beauty's such a finite thing / That's lost when it is won;  / There's just not enough to go around.  / But look...! / I caught the sun.
After supper / on crossed paws, / The cat meditates
Why the hell is it getting worse?
Brokenback goodshit / Heap bigshot / among the Birchtrees.
Love is a momentary thing. / I’d rather spend a moment / whispering through cupped hands  / than an eternity / remembering a long forgotten dance.
Losing huge chunks of time. / I don't know what to do anymore. / I don't know what to say. / I don't know what this is anymore.
The mist in front / of the morning mountains / late Autumn
she felt small annoyances and laughed / with strangers (what a time to be alive / and you wouldn't have seen this when we were young)  / drunk in pubs at sunday brunch / with a weak london sun attempting to breach / grimy windows.
Kneedeep, teeth / to the blizzard, / My cat gazing at me
Days  / now fade to black.
Late April / dusk bluster / Lions & lambs
I just...want to sleep / I use sleep to escape
Someday, we will sit intimately as old friends do / Exchange pleasantries and engage in a little playful arguing as we have always done / And when I'm sure all other stories have been told, I will ask you if you have time for one more
I wrote a lullaby / And sang it to you soft.
I could tell  / that whenever I stare into your eyes / And you spill the entirety of the world / into mine
one day a crab decided to enroll in a liberal arts college and the crab became a hipster crab and all his crab friends left him because they said he read too much and quoted passages from tao lin constantly
The tree looks / like a dog / Barking at Heaven
Now we reach for what to say  / When the silence is too strong. / But nothing seems to reach. / Forever is too long.
so I exhaled quick  / poured it out  / and that was that.
Forms. / Urine samples. / Blood tests. / Questionnaires. / Diagnoses. / Discharge.
A man sits alone / in the place he calls home / and he sits in his chair and he weeps
"don't you put that on me" i sighed / at the shadow of the face i might've lost
i don't know if it was  / disbelief / apathy / or loneliness / but i didn't listen.
The taste / of rain / Why kneel?
Girl with wagon / what do / I know?
Rat Pack rhymes / And Blues that still had soul. / Great like sacrosanct springing suburbs / With two-car garages / And no bursting bubbles
They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something. / If that is true then I am a master of sleeping alone. / Nights upon nights of twin mattresses  / I racked up hours  / Nine at a time  / To be the best at being alone.
He’s a sweet kisser / when he’s sober  / and leaves bruises on my thighs / after a couple beers.
my mind can’t answer when you call / if it did I’d be stealing your life from you
so many paths go up from the foothills / but one moon grazes the peak
and write poems about The Coffeeshop Girl. / (He's probably writing a novel...)  / The Coffeeshop Girl and I are in love but we're both too shy to admit it. / We tell each other in subtle ways.
Someday, I'll talk in detail / Of how, for a while, you were my home / I'll let you in on how the thought of spending the rest of my life with you seemed—for a moment—blissful
gravestones melt to stumps of stone knobs / use them to grind tea leaves
Grass waves, / hens chuckle, / Nothing’s happening
Great again like / Living the American Dream / Presented on a
she had a couple of lovers / who took shifts licking her downy / cunt and soft belly with a slight snail trail / that faded at the belly button.
you do not love me in the dark  / and i miss you in the always.
Mist boiling from the / ridge the mountains / Are clean
The sun keeps getting / dimmer foghorns / began to blow in the bay
There’s a bump on a part of this gypsy man’s cart / And it thumps with each turn of the wheel. / It keeps him in time with his plucking and rhyme / As he rides it from Rome to Castile.
An end to love, success, and joy / Mountains, green pastures, and streams. / Instead he was faced with horrors untold / And nights he filled with screams.
Leaves skittering on / the tin roof / August fog in Big Sur
The needle won't reach the record  / And the smile doesn't quite reach the eyes  / And my brain can't reach around  / Why his warmth didn't reach inside.
When I look into her eyes  / I hear  / “Don’t even bother. / I am the poetry you can never write.”
A car is coming but / the cat knows / It's not a snake
Do you show empathy for others? / Have you been having a hard time / Waking up? / Does it sometimes feel
I have to admit my passion never leaves / fire is the master young grasses appear each spring
The maze is full of  / Circles and dead ends.  / Two may enter a pair  / But part as just friends.
from their / pupils: / “what is your favorite constellation?” / and  / smiling in that half-madness
Arms folded / to the moon, / Among the cows
how, even after your business trips  / you were too tired to brush a strand of her / hair back or at least pretend to care. / now, you must practice the art of dismembering
and write about things I often forget / like the fact that smoke tastes good / and e-cigs provide no warmth.
I’m so mad / I could bite / The montaintops
and He hugged me tight  / in the warmest grip  / and then He held  / for too long.
I fear that time and space no longer matter.  / Nor fear of death itself. / There only exists you.  / And i.  / And the deafening silence between us
So now the whole space of my stardom is waning fast. / Can’t think of anything better to do… / Except!
You died today  / I don't know what to say. / Our bed is just how we left it / And your winter boots are still in the doorway  / Your car is covered in snow and will be moved tomorrow.
Count the hairs trapped between the  / tines. Three, four, five. No, six. More  / than yesterday. Pop three pills in  / my grimace and hope for the best.  / Maybe there will be fewer  / tomorrow.
And people  / will be there too. / After twenty years I hear  / how I talk  / when I hear them. / The subtle inflection  / feels like a key
He turns to page 683
A lakeside sunrise like blood in the water  / Half hearted musings of meaningless slaughter  / Lifetimes of heartache and wasted ambition  / Carelessness curses the human condition
Churchbells ringing in town / The caterpillar / In the grass
I can't take it anymore. / Sick of this crap. Nothing helps for long. Too old for this shit. / So angry all the time. / I’ve actually orgasmed / to the thought of shooting myself.
One foot on the bar / of soap, / The Bluejay peeking
Phantom Rose / Lust / Is a Leopard
Let tears dampen cheeks today  / Let whimpers pierce the night. / Let despair have its way, for once  / to soften terror's bite.
She sat next to him  / They shot the breeze  / I'm sure they grinned.
So we sat there / in silence / basking / in our own intellect and sophistication / saying not a single word / so as to not disillusion ourselves.
If you can take five weeks off me  / maybe take a little more  / because when I was here five weeks ago / there was no blood on Highway Four.
six years of hunger sitting like a secret in darkness / his bones pierced with the less-and-less the near-nothing
she used to smoke us like a cigarette / between yellowed fingers / and throaty gasps.
I’m back here in the middle / of nowhere / At least I think so
using the bathroom in someone else's house when you have social anxiety
That you carry your past on your back. / But I will always remember how / You left the fire
so I exhaled quick  / shook my head  / and that was that.
Sometimes I think
O for / Vermont again / The barn on an Autumn night
or that time you wanted to hang out  / and i missed doing college applications for you / or that time i wanted to talk  / and you were too busy being you  / or those times i needed a friend
And if you wish to be without me / Then that's perfect too / You are the best thing that'll never happen to me
That's it. I give up.
Not here.
David Bowie died thirteen days / after I sat next to my grandma / while she slowly did the same  / and my aunt said she wanted / Space Oddity to play at her funeral / and I could only ask: / Why not Golden Years?
And said I couldn't go / "Me first!" you whispered / As if you could know / It was only cancer / We've got so much to do / I was thirty years old / When I loved you / My body numbed
Walking down the road / with dog / a crushed snake.
Two Japanese boys / singing / Inky Dinky Parly Voo
the edges of the sword are life and death / no one knows which is which
The moon is white / the lamps are / Yellow
Walking down the road with Jack / a crushed snake
she’d play with it almost anywhere day and night / touch it with the deepest part of herself
Old man of Aix / white hair, beret / Gone up the Cezanne street
no more Zen write one great line / like a needle piercing a sore spot on your arm
where you are whatever you do / hearing a stalk struck remember bamboo remembers nothing
His own mind betrayed / Wants not to be saved / So alone, there he sits, until dead.
beer has moved on; why can’t I? / And that’s why beer is a poet  / and I’m just a sad drunk - still / coming to grips with suicide.
Vixens, pixies, sirens, gypsies / They fill a void in me every time / And every time I fill them / With my “love” and bullshit
Yank through a knot with all the  / subtlety of a boxer, because that's  / what I was trained to do. Fight the  / world, beat it back from the doorstep  / never give them the upperhand  / and don't let them see you  / cry.
Snow on the grape / arbor – the little / dead raisins
don't wait for the man standing in the snow / to cut off his arm help him now
If I had God's phone number I'd send him things like / "Thank you for making sure I didn't die in my sleep" or / "Did you make it so that humans couldn't fly for a reason or were you just being a jerk?"
I found my love in kitten's purr  / in fox's squeak, in metal's burr  / in molten glass and depths of space - / still I see little of her face.
A long island / in the sky / The Milky Way
A mother & son / just took a shortcut / Thru my yard
She said, "I think today  / will be the last day I live." / And I asked her for one more.
What is stranger than a stranger? / A meeting 13 billion years in the making. / What countless causes conspired for this coincidence of conditions?
He stood once more no strength remained / His soles and soul succumb / His heart of stone lay shattered, still / His song a beating drum.
believe in the man facing you now / just narrow your eyes feel the deep love
Sixty sunsets have I seen / revolve on this perpendicular hill
I know it hasn't been long but: / Remember when you fell asleep in my bed? / You're still sleeping there now / I broke off alone to go and think / and for the first time in a long time I feel content / I guess I feel a little too content / Because I finally know that / You aren't still hers—
But she knows / And I know / She’s thirsty too / She drinks me / I taste like beer / She’s still here
Elephants munching / on grass loving / Head side by side
The people all flock as the gypsy cart rocks / And approaches the town from afar  / And they dance to his song as he rolls right along / To the beat of his Spanish Guitar.
Because I've had his number for a while now / And I've sent all of those messages / I think God might be out of service / So I sent him one more message saying "I don't think I believe in you anymore"
You’ve forgotten how to make love under the open sky.
i wanted to put you in my pocket / and pretend you were a coin / i would roll you around / among the lint and spent
Sun shining on / A distant mountain / the low moon
The microscopic red bugs / in the sea-side sand / Do they meet and greet?
Looking at me  / she ran her fingers  / down her hips  / across scars  / and said
And the mechanical whir of the fan  / was replaced by your / Palpable  / Heartbeat. / I thought I had mastered sleeping alone  / Then in that one night  / I just forgot how  / Next to you  / Near you.
By the echoes of her high-heeled retreat / And practice. / Great like the end of the wife’s / Goddamn nagging
November how nasal / the drunken / Conductor's call
Sits in a galactic carriage
She loves Lysander / not Demetrius / Who? Hermia
I remembered my father's words as I put on my sweater / He said "Son, sometimes life doesn't get any better" / Now it's time, once again, to get it all back in order / Even though heartbreak is waiting just around the corner
In a Mojave dust storm / Albert said: "Senzeie, / Was a Mongolian waif"
The droopy constellation / on the grassy hill / Emily Dickinson’s Tomb
I found my love in orchards wide  / in emerald hearts, in blushing bride  / in phoenix down and warrens deep - / that which I know, I dare not keep.
don't hesitate get laid that's wisdom / sitting around chanting what crap
Moon in the / bird bath / One star too
"Milf Alert!" Johnny said / As I'm lost, floating through my own brain / "Dude", he said, as if it were my name  / "Look at the ass on that one."
My health is deteriorating and there’s nothing the doctors can do. / Hello.
and then there was flore and cathy and hannah and Jessica  / oh, how I loved Jessica  / She was rainbows and sunshine  / She read yeats and keats and all that
Then suddenly one day, we fell apart without a clue / We're talking less and laughing less and keep on feeling blue. / Get the check, by myself, at a table set for two  / So I took it and signed my name.
I told my girlfriend several days later and she broke up with me. / Last week, I sent them both a dozen roses  / Anonymously.
even if Buddha himself kneeled at my deathbed / he wouldn't be worth shit
Rainy night, / the top leaves wave / In the grey sky
Quietly pouring coffee / in the afternoon, / How pleasant!
Gaudy / Supplicating / An elf surely
and eventually i would ride under a clothesline and acquire a new skin; a better one / i'd also bump my head on a low-hanging street lamp and my brain would fall out with a resigned squelch / and along the way i would pick up a new brain from a black market organ dealer in chicago
nobody knows shit nobody lives anywhere / hello dust!
The rain has filled / the birdbath / Again, almost
Propped up on my shoe / the Diamond Sutra / Propped up on a pine root
I kinda wanna  / go to the loony bin -- / Lobotomy Land / for the barely there. / Bridgewater State  / with smoke breaks
But when the honeymoon ends / and the mask falls off / It's much more difficult / to do more than scoff / Because after eleven months / when you gave it your all / you're told to fuck off / and find out you were nothing / but a glorified booty call
i remember when i fucked / for the first time  / i was 18 and stick-thin and awkward  / and i didn’t know his name
The leaves, fighting / the empty sky / No clouds helping
Wednesday blah / blah blah / My mind hurts
my friend's funeral this morning / burns inside me like my own death
Barley soup in Scotland / in November / Misery everywhere
September raindrops / from my roof / Soon icicles
Every morning I order a double americano / (So refined!) / and a fresh pastry  / (How continental!)
Take up a cup of water / from the ocean / And there I am
The colors are all so vivid  / And the dialogue is scripted. / These life roles, we just fill in  / With some broken down commitments. / Mindset atavistic
I cannot live without your love so looking down and then above / The waves they crash and roar and shove
Sometimes she'd speak like a pirate / Just to get a laugh
I am eager for breath  / But a twinge of worry - / for missing the depth  / And so I tarry.
ten years of whorehouse joy I'm alone now in the mountains / the pines are like a jail the wind scratches my skin
The morning began with coffee and toast / And browsing the web for news / The world was a veritable hotbed it seemed / Of geopolitical feud
I’m in it everywhere. / what a miracle trees lakes clouds even dust
sexual love's attachment pain is deeper that I can know / wind soothes my thoughts this lust my ceaseless koan / impossibly happy
You did nothing / (wrong). / I regret everything / (we won’t get to do). / I’m so(rry.)
Listening to birds using / different voices, losing / My perspective of History
Who wrote anger in your eyes / and signed it / "I love you."
Wake / Look around / She’s still here
Kicked the couch / Last night / She’s right / She's still here
stand tiptoe on the tip of a needle / like a grain of sand flashing in sunlight
Waiting for the leaves / to fall; / There goes one!
they screw inside the temple call in students for “mysterious satori” / only I teach like the seasons
The Ten Commandments / And those damn commie bastards. / Great like / The perpetual and proud roll of
I had seventeen more pounds on me / and must have sat up taller too  / because when I was here five weeks ago / I had a different point of view.
what I’m trying to say is you’re very beautiful! / And to be a hundred percent honest with you  / if I didn’t at least ask your name  / why  / I’d be as bitter as this black coffee! / Ha!”
Love is a playful thing. / I envy the wind  / when it gets to play with your hair. / And I envy the grass  / that gets to tickle your dancing feet.
this is the romance sold at every corner / and thrown away by the end of the week. / am i wooing you yet? / lean in and smell the perfume
I  / the lonely soul / Write alone.
There is no deep / turning-about / In the Void
I won't die I won't go away I'll always be here / no good asking me I won't speak
but too often it reads like / you took a piss on my porch and sighed. / if the petals you dribble over my bed / are rotted through, plucked from a bouquet / you threw out two months ago
I don't own a sewing needle but I keep calligraphy / in a special box given by my dying friend
Our kids are graduating. / We see each other at the ceremony. / We wave. / The kids ask us who we are. / Nobody. / They run to their / New friends. / Passing time.
The pine woods / move / In the mist
you looked at me and asked if / i wanted to end / it / and i said no
The dog yawned / and almost swallowed / My Dharma
It's grainy
another house has its own path through the dark / what about when moss grows on the heart’s road
None of that devil’s music and improper gyration / No bathroom bills or gender improvisation / All fixed behind closed doors with enforced reformation / To Protect and to Serve just one population  / And helped by the business end / Of a truncheon.
and i held you in my arms one last time / tears streaming down our faces / and i cursed God / and i cursed myself
Rinzai did it without a care / no clouds wind sky a heart that simply sings
Early morning with the / happy dogs / I forgot the Path
How do I cope? / I signed up for counselling today
i said i’m sorry i've ruined your night  / i should go.
so burning’s knowing and I’m not even drunk on three wines / plunge into the fire reality pure endless pain
Zen's finished stick your brain in a peach branch guzzle sake / sing until you have no throat then words come by themselves
"goodnight" / and her skin left cold hand-shaped prints as  / the creak of wooden boards left beneath her / shoes and she sung into the night  / "goodbye, love, goodnight"  / and my frozen lips whispered  / "alright, death, sleep tight."
up all night in this fisherman’s hut drinking talking / his wife hates me bangs her spoon on the kettle
Summer night / the kitten playing / With the Zen calendar
In the middle of / the corn, a new / Car slithering
Later that night I dialed  / your number  / but then I remembered you quit
I may be old but I recall the plot of your first book  / Where Mary fell in love with Henry Gimble’s Pastry Cook  / I also have a corner kept for all the art you drew  / I always liked the one you did of Howard feeling blue.
That I can be / A better mistake / Next time
Shall I say no? / fly rubbing / its back legs
Hot tea, in the cold / moonlit snow / a burp
rice boils in my broken-footed iron pot / it’s everything but you can’t taste it
A bubble, a shadow / woop / The lightning flash
Am I actually depressed? / I was never depressed until now.
Geronimo, in Autumn / says no to peaceful / Cochise Smoke rises
The bitterness and anger between / You and I / Are gone, like the ashes of the fire.
Oh another weekend’s / started – people squeaking / On U-turning tires
Autumn nite / Lucien leans to Jack / on the couch.
Some will feel / like the Sun / and others  / like new parts  / I forgot
On Starvation Ridge / little sticks / Are trying to grow
Autumn nite / my mother remembers / my birth
When came the time to leave again / I bade the lovely fox remain  / For my path led through the unknown / A journey safest made alone  / I could not bear her come to harm; / So stood the fox and I.

do you remember the time / we drove to the mountains and it snowed / and i kissed your cold sweet lips / and we defrosted our feet / under warm wool sheets
The Sunny Breeze / will come to me / Presently
One drop from / the blue spruce / two more drops
New neighbors / light / In the old house
There once was a boy, an innocent child / Whose heart was filled with dreams / He dreamed of love, success, and joy / Mountains, green pastures, and streams.
Something was lost to us though – the tangible.
Sitting Bull adjust / his girdle: the smell / Of smoking fish
"This is the worst ginger ale I've had in my life" / I said to the white walls and fluorescent lights / A record-setting breakdown, achieving the impossible / Shooting for the moon and landing in the hospital -
Thunder and snow / how / We shall go!
In enormous blizzard / burying everything / My cat turned back
I'm lonely and I'm bitter and I'm rotting at my core / My eyes are windows to my soul because I locked the door / The things I do to feel alive won't be done anymore / I guess I'll just keep living, although I do not know what for
look up Heaven look around you Earth red flesh white bones crushed / between both the real you survives
How sad it must be, to be one less than infinity / Knowing that you are so close, yet so far from free / By leaps and bounds, striving towards the impossible / Knowing that your chances are simply improbable / How sad it must be, to be one less than infinity
Waiting for the Zipper / 4 PM / Sun in West clouds, gold
you'd yawn and curl your toes  / glance to your glaring phone / and in my room, standing there / I'd know who was alone.
We sit in sacred silence, a captive congregation. / Spines straight, fingers folded  / a plastic smile slashed through each manufactured visage  / nostrils upturned at the lingering stench  / blood and sex and shame.
the rosiness of the cheeks / the sweep of the hair / I know that smile / and the happiness it yields
I found my love in Mimir's well  / in Avalon, in Dante's Hell  / in Middle-Earth and Homer's Troy - / and still, I'm no more than a boy.
Woke up groaning / with a dream of a priest / Eating chicken necks
Dawn wind / in the spruces / The late moon
Walking down the road / with Allen / An old dream / the same dream.
A balloon caught / in the tree – dusk / In Central Park zoo
Christ on the Cross crying / his mother missed / Her October porridge
Reflected upsidedown / in the sunset lake, pines, / Pointing to infinity
If I go out now, / my paws / will get wet
Shall I break God's commandment? / Little fly / Rubbing its back legs
I'm pure shame / what I do and what I say never the same
a well nobody dug filled with no water / ripples and a shapeless weightless man drinks
outrageous eyes ears nose in the cold one silent tinkling bell / clear beautiful nudged by the wind hangs over the polished railing
April mist / under the pine / At midnight
It’s 3:00am  / and I should have gone to sleep
Your belly’s too big / for your / Little teeth
But I can count how many replies I've gotten on less than one hand / If I had God's phone number / I'd call him to ask "did you really need to take my best friend so early?"
For brevity’s sake, I’m doing okay. / You may have noticed there  / that pause that I placed  / so you might be aware / that I’m desperately struggling / to surface for air  / and failing in the worst kind of way.
Kicked the cupboard / and hurt my toe / Rage
I've burnt all the holy pages I used to carry / but poems flare in my heart
Great like the right kind over here / And “your kind” over there / Did you hear what I said to you, boy? / Great like segregated schools for segregated homes  / No unnatural unions of this or that nature
i could not blame you when / you grew wings and flew away / my crane wife
The earth winked / at me right / In the john
And as I know that smile  / I know it has never been for me / But for him.
and i am freaking out / and i am very scared / and i have no drugs to calm me down / and i will never sleep again / and someone will find my drugs
And right before I really lose it / Before I come undone
Put on some fancy clothes / Look better, feel better, be better / All dressed up and no where to go / Everything is a fucking joke
Ikkyū near death returns your cloak to you / slash it in half and it's still yours

He told me that travel is stupid / because the only thing it can ever teach you is that / everyone is exactly the same
are you enjoying reading my poems? / i actually don't even know if they count as poems / maybe if i put in arbitrary enjambment
I went half crazy studying sitting for days now the one thing / is fishermen's songs sunset rain clouds the river night after night
“Hi! So okay, I know I’m a stranger  / and that you don’t know me  / and I don’t know you
and lots of pointless sensory descriptions / about trees / then i will be a real poet / i will buy a beret
Ghengis Khan looks fiercely / east, with red eyes, / Hungering for Autumn vengeance
At least, I think he does; / maybe I just want him to.
Black bird no! / bluebird pear / Branch still jumping
so many words about it / the only language is you don't open your lips
How cold! – late / September baseball / The crickets
One day I stretched out both my arms / And cupped my hands like so; / And quick, just like a dragonfly  / I pulled the sun down low.
The falling snow / The hissing radiators / The bride out there
I am the mountain, clothed in cold  / who learned instead to burn like suns –  / A blazing, blissful pyre for  / the cow’ring unenlightened ones.
Came down from my / ivory tower / And found no world
All I see is what / I see / Red fire sunset
Dawn – the writer who / hasn’t shaved, / Poring over notebooks
I think my girlfriend is getting sick of my shit.
I woke up / two flies were boffing / On my forehead
listen whose face is it a piece / of sunlit jade warbling laughing
All these sages / Sleep / with their mouths open
stirring cold ashes with his eyes shut tight / another student weeps into the sparks
Once her heart switches its beat  / everything you once did as a treat  / now are things that made you a creep
They shake their glossed bald heads at the local UPS  / scoff when I suggest overnight express. / Not even the reliable men & women of FedEx / can aid my victory for intergalactic acclaim.
Hitch hiked a thousand / miles and brought / You wine
poetry's ridiculous write it feel proud / strut look in the mirror believe you know
rippling at its very ridges  / an inky night ocean / specked with drops of starlight / like static snowfall… / there are times / late at night
We're all in love / with The Coffeeshop Girl.
Alone, in old / clothes, sipping wine / Beneath the moon
My flashlight, / where I put it this afternoon / Twisted away in sleep
Answered a letter / and took a hot bath / Spring rain
cheap tea thin gruel pale leaves as winter begins / this threadbare robe feels fine in the first dawn frost
to love their spouses and mothers and children / to feed their pets and eat the rest / and get on with it.
Pink petals on / gnarly Japanese twigs / In rain
you looked at me and asked if / it was the right thing to do / to end / it / and i said yes
Is it the weather? / Is it the mood? / Am i lost in some deep brood? / I am at sea sir, at sea.
the car is not stopping / my eyes are closed / i am thinking hard / the giant hamster wheels in my brain are spinning really fast / in my head i am eighteen years old
I drink my tea / and say / Hm hm
The rose moves / like a Reichian disciple / On its stem
Barefoot by the sea, / stopping to scratch one ankle / With one toe
There’s a whale  / dwelling in the wishing well of my stomach  / like the universe, a widening plummet
like a knifeblade the moon will be full then less / than nothing but it`s dawn and the moon`s a knifeblade
her mouth played with my cock / the way a cloud plays with the sky
I was reunited with this old feeling / And briefly, actually thought I was healing / But you merely thought of love as a chore / So you’ve hurt me more / Hurt me more
a broken sleeper, never to wake up / I didn't like you / but we were brothers forged in the crucible / our eagle globe and anchor made us family
October wind crosses the world / in this field moist grass bends to itself and to the sea
Was it our fault? We still wonder / To walk into your room, where I discover / Your body still swinging, like in summer
Do you think her kisses taste like helium? / Do you get lifted off your toes when you see her, your heart ascending to meet hers in a solar cadenza?
A pussywillow grew there / At the foot / Of the breathless tree
with the Universe / to take her by the hand / and out of the atmosphere  / to drift by the pale blue dot / we called home and wave  / to refuge on the outskirts of Pluto  / and swing on the rings of Saturn. / So I lifted the glasses
Unwell is an understatment. / Not quite such, the likes of this. / No cures yet, no medicines / For this specific ailment.
Haiku my eyes! / my mother is calling!
The dark clouds rage  / The sea wind wails  / No dawn breaks  / I am at sea.
He stood atop the clouds and yelled / Triumphant as the sun / I know the darkness fades to day / I know my heart has won.
it isn't that we're alone or not alone / whose voice do you want mine? yours?
No telegram today / Only more / Leaves fell
the shifting truths and kaleidoscope fears inside his soul  / do you coax them out with a warm, empathic coo  / and as you have seen him, has he seen you?
i have no friends and no future prospects and i'm poor and feel inferior to everyone and my life is shit / i am writing a poetry collection to express how sad i am and to maybe come to terms with it and embark on the long process of self-acceptance and rehabilitation
Everyone of my knocks / disturbs my daughter / Sleeping in her December grave
Having talent is a skill. As / is rendering talent obsolete when / someone has to be. Goddamnit. / He’s gone and done it. He’s / broken those legs that made / strong men cry.

Autumn night / low moon / Fire in Smithtown
thirsty you dream of water cold you want fire / not me I want the firm warm breasts and wetness of a woman

Hearing your voice is the only way I can fall asleep now.

for my cool sheets / fuel fever dreams / of each sweetheart / this tantric town / has ever offered.
this morning's koan's a poem tonight people flock to this mountain / I live the problem ignore poor birds pleading for food
Birds singing / in the dark / In the rainy dawn

In Autumn Geronimo / weeps no pony / With a blanket
Good news and bad news. / I almost reached the point of no return.
Early morning yellow flowers / Thinking about / The drunkards of Mexico
The little white cat / Walks in the grass / With his tail up in the air
They spin their thirty caliber yarns / In towers, trenches, and lofts.
Some, when I meet them / will feel, with weird feelings / like parts of myself I have  / been avoiding
there's a man sitting on the gum spotted sidewalk  / chewed up and spit out, spit on and stepped on.
I didn't choose to be sad / I'm not a magic man / I can't just wave my fucking hand / And suddenly be happy again
This is a far cry from wine in the north of Italy  / Petty mud-water that stares with its greasy eyes  / A little flatfish waiting to seize its prey. / My head nods on the counter
We're together, it's euphoric, a sensation that I love. / A needle sent down to my arm from Heaven up above. / The lows seem unimportant when I'm riding out the highs. / We're together, it's euphoric, I lean back and close me eyes.
mirror facing mirror / nowhere else
Just say the grace of your face / caused my heart pace / to elate at an alarming rate / and inspired a lust / only you can satiate / It must be fate.
Shooting star! – no, / lightning bug! / ah, well, June night

Spring is coming / Yep, all that equipment / for sighs
and then Bridget and I  / made the sweetest love  / even though  / she was drunk  / and even though  / she has a rape  / fantasy  / and her finger slid  / into my  / butt  / and the next morning
pieces of her in the tiny nook set out for reading / and in the colors of your shower curtains / like repeatedly ripping velcro  / off of the heart you thought she would spend / an eternity in.
I have to move it then put it back every time I want milk / It has been there for at least 4 weeks already
Red roses, white / clouds, blue sky, / In my birdbath
Maybe if the sidewalk widened, or the sailor had more skill / Or if I didn't need to take so many pills / Or if my feet stopped dangling over this window sill  / The things I do to feel alive will come in for the kill
Damn, another lonely night.  / Damn, fill the upright shot glass.
as I long to see it again / I know it is futility / For I know that smile
how is my hand like Mori's? / it's her freedom I love when I'm sick she makes me hard / fingers lips rove everywhere brings my followers joy
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief – / She was pregnant; I felt shock, and also, shamefully, relief. / Her parents were traditional; there would be no abortion. / This child would bring our marriage, although practicing extortion.
Bird bath trashing, / by itself / Autumn wind
Inside and out / And I’m hopeful / That they will make / A better mistake next time
"you're a peach" she said / as i held the door for her. we found / a maintenance hallway perfect for sneaking / into the movie theater after it had closed. / it would be just one of
Everything is gray. / I don't know what this feeling is, I was hoping someone could help me.

As the cool evenings / make themselves felt, / Smoke from suburban chimneys
I’m eighty still alive looking up every night / snapping my fingers at time at the promise of love
memory thieving smarties / with their  / Easter egg colors. / We'll catch them in our hands / and stuff them in our mouths

Standing on the end / on top of the tree, / The Big Dipper
Sunny day – bird tracks / & cat tracks / In the snow
The bird’s still on top / of that tree, / High above the fog

Old man dying in a room / Groan / At five o’clock
I rubbed my bearded / cheek and looked in / The mirror – Ki!
I wanna do something but I just don't feel like it. / I just want to be alone. I hate feeling lonely.
After the earthquake, / A child crying / In the silence
Morning sarcastically caresses  / each pit, bump and scar on my left  / cheek. I find I have started to like  / the right half of my face more  / partially veiled in brief 7 o'clock  / shadows.
my dying teacher could not wipe himself unlike you disciples / who use bamboo I cleaned his lovely ass with my bare hands
Love is a quiet thing. / Your laugh is all the music I need  / I hear its every note. / The way it weaves past your teeth  / and is shaped and colored by your tongue and lips.
the crow's caw was ok but one night with a lovely whore / opened a wisdom deeper than what that bird said
I don’t feel like I deserve them / And when they discard me / I’m less bitter and more grateful / Grateful that I was allowed to know them
Self-reflections. / How could you could make your death look accidental?
In the late afternoon / peaks, I see / The hope
icy window windy snow moon tangled among black flowers / the mind is water wrapping itself where it is around what what what / never the same
The night / is red / with stars
my name Ikkyū's disgusting not dust yet / it should be swept away and will be
Lin-chi screamed KATSU! at precisely the right time gave life death KATSU! / eyes everywhere blazing blazing eyes sun moon KATSU! KATSU!
you me when I think really think about it / are the same
sin like a madman until you can't do anything else / no room for any more
"Stop," / licked my cheek / to my ear  / finishing
Thompson’s acid caps / for Chinese research chemicals
poetry's hellish bullshit one good way to suffer men love it / men stupid as horses cows
Is your head occasionally / Plotting against you? / Do you suddenly want to / Kill yourself at
Just want to talk to someone. / Should I tell my best friend that I am having suicidal thoughts?  / Friends don't exist.
aspirations shut tight like pearls in clams  / moonlight in my hands  / reminiscing lambent plankton
Late into the night / When moonlight filters through my curtains / and my eyes are at half-mast / and my body is limp with approaching sleep / I still feel her hand caressing my hair
We'll bump into each other at the same local places we used to frequent. / We'll fight over buying the next round, and joke about how / It was so different Back then.
Prime time, baby. I’ve / waited for this –
Three pencils arranged, / Three minutes, / Sambaghakaya, Nirvanakaya, Dharmakaya
We all want to tell about our bad habits  / how we tore them off like bandages and new skin / bloomed underneath them. / Scars are just new masks, I say  / but that is a very unpopular opinion.
Cool sunny autumn day, / I’ll mow the lawn / one last time
Sometimes / I fall apart / because I spilled water all over the table / and I can’t stop myself from repeating over and over / “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” / because I’m such a disappointment
Neons, Chinese restaurants / coming on / Girls come by shades
You said that you liked peeling oranges  / Liberating the fragile life that’s been walled off  / I said that it seemed intrusive  / You said that it was satisfying
Reading the sutra / I decided / To go straight
Cold gray tufts / of winter grass / Under the stars
Coffee beans! / Methinks I smell / The Canaries!
don’t worry please please how many times do I have to say it / there’s no way not to be who you are and where.
Wind too strong / empty nest / At midnight
You died today  / There is nothing I can say. / I am lost in our home looking at what was. / Last night's supper still waits for you on the table... / The last time we touched, I was angry at you, and I'm sorry.
though you are talking / right through me / something about / scott flanders
beloved Wei-shan wanted to come back as a cow grazing in a wide valley / can't you see him munching flowers idling under stars on a windy night
A whole pussywillow / over there, / Unblown
desolation / and hope. / it is a paradox / that spirals out  / of all possibility
three-foot axe leans on the headsman's block / cuts through deep feelings April
All day long wearing / a hat that wasn't / On my head
You only love me in the dark.  / I only miss you in the light.  / as morning's first kiss peeks your rosy cheek  / your feelings fade away  / and my longing begins to grow.
do you remember the time / we got lost in a rainstorm / and my shoes got so soggy / i threw them away and bought new ones
Who the fuck / Owns that broccoli
The windmills of / Oklahoma look / In every direction
What now?
Grain Elevators are tall trucks / that let the road / approach them
in deep winter I write poems get drunk the cup's heavier heavier moon / whispering all night even at sixty I'm hard in her again and again
My cat eating / at his saucer / Spring moon
Men and women / Yakking beneath / the eternal Void
has a boy ever been naked before you?  / really naked  / has he turned to face you after the golden hours fade, and said:  / “I’m afraid of the world and what it wants from me”
like the Red Sea / and erased their white masses / with the edges of my thumbs  / careful not to nudge her / from the grasps of sleep. / I wanted to share her beauty
this boat is and is not / When it sinks both disappear
Oh how you've snared me with your vines I cannot flee thee / Let me go, I ask; Oh darling wont you free me?
Nat Wills, a tramp / America / In 1905
Sitting so close that our heartbeats syncopate  / Yet between us a gulf too deep for words to fill  / Too wide to dare to bridge.
Frozen / in the birdbath, / A leaf
Terraces of fern / in the dripping / Redwood shade
So I go to sleep. / And here you are. / And here I am.
In my medicine cabinet / the winter fly / Has died of old age
In the quiet house, / my mother's / Moaning yawns
If a giggle was worth a nickel / I couldn't finish the math
to excel there’s a need to expel  / excruciatingly, slowly, out of me, he arcs  / never knew whales were made of a million sparks…
The top of Jack / Mountain – done in / By golden clouds
When her hair moves and the light hits it a certain way, can you tell it’s woven with bits of wheat and prairie grass? / Are her fingers always this sticky with maple syrup, sugar leaking out of every pore, embalmed in vestal amber sap?
I'm going to die alone  / As someone's best friend.  / I'm frothing, seizing  / Right behind them
my brain and i do not get along / he is a leo while i am a taurus  / one night he wakes me up at 3 am / it is the middle of the night so i was dreaming
We don't talk anymore / when I'm awake. / But you already knew that.
We'll try again  / tomorrow. / Won't we?
Nored the Atlantican Astrologer / weeps because the King / Laid his Autumn girl!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
They'll go out to the bars  / They'll have drinks  / and jovial times.
Winking over his pipe / the Buddha lumberman / Nowhere
Late afternoon / my bare back’s / Cold
Poor tortured teeth / under / The blue sky
nobody told the flowers to come up nobody / will ask them to leave when spring’s gone
I would fill the silence with a fan blowing sweet static into my ear until I slumbered. / It was perfect. / Then you ruined it  / That night I slept wrapped around you  / I didn't need blankets  / Your slow, regular breaths were warm enough.
Spring night – the sound / of the cat / Chewing fish heads
as infinite as we’d think it to be  / and that our lives or this world  / for that matter, aren’t nearly as infinite / as we’d think them to be
Bird was gone / and distance grew / Immensely white
"Me first" you wrote / As you planned in your head / You ended your life / Before chemo round two / I was thirty one years old / When I lost you / Tear it to shreds. / -som
Forgotten history to us is the struggle to / capture the American Dream.
We wanted different things / You and I / But wanted so many things alike.
Three in the morning? / Where do you go / When you get stir- / crazy?
that stone Buddha deserves all the birdshit it gets / I wave my skinny arms like a tall flower in the wind
Bach through an open / dawn window / the birds are silent
once while she was cooking I kneeled put my head between her warm dark legs / up her skirt kissed and licked and sucked her until she came
I suppose that after rapaciously consuming enough pornography, some folks start to look at the little things again. / She raises her hand

and sweet  / Darren  / who didn’t know what  / Drug i was on  / when we met.
Rub eyes / Deep breath – “Ouch!” / Fuck / New bruise / “Fuck”
Holding up my purring / cat to the moon, / I sighed
Wash hung out / by moonlight / Friday night
Perfect moonlit night / marred / By family squabbles
self other right wrong wasting your life arguing / you're happy really you are happy
Two years went by, we drift apart, you've someone on the side / You keep it low but girl I know, you have nowhere to hide / He showed up soon, with a divorce, then asked "could you please sign?" / So I took it and signed my name.
happy people do not deserve the happiness they have because they do not appreciate it like we sad people do
Someday is not today, tomorrow, or the day after that / Someday, should it exist, is when we have settled comfortably into our lives and our arms are home to different people / When there are too many things standing in the way of us acting on our whims / When declarations of former non-platonic love can do no harm
The sky is still empty, / the rose is still / On the typewriter keys
The gypsy man plays on warm summer days / And on nights neath a lonesome bright star. / He plucks a soft tune as he howls at the moon / With the song of his Spanish Guitar.
The white cat / Is green in the tree shade, / Like Gauguin’s horse
Gossiping takes practice when / time is never of the essence. / God has not aged well and / is in danger of becoming  / a neo-spiritualist. He wears / glasses like Buddy Holly and / practices yoga. Stay  / flexible. Stay relevant.
life's like climbing knife-tree hills with swords sticking up / day and night something stabs you
Your smile is a drug to me / With a strong high but a week-long crash / Your laugh is a sweet, soothing melody / That slowly falls out of tune
Sadness / Longing / Ache, and hurt / Have driven me to love  / And given birth
one day i will destroy the world from the inside-out with a giant robot arm that i will build myself in my / mother's basement while subsisting on a diet entirely comprised of mountain dew and doritos and i will show you all who the fucking nerd is
Great again like the mad men days / Of slinging a two-bit smile at some broad / And then a slap on the ass as she walks by / Her inner rage subdued
needy texts / empty sex.
> Liquidate emotional_assets / Say: “fuck it”; play - {RADIOHEAD; ; AMBIENT_COMFORT}
And last I have the biggest part saved for the thought of you  / You may be gone but I recall the life we have been through / You were my wife, my love & life the day that we first met  / I can't recall the world and more, but you I can’t forget.
Finally got round to getting some psychiatric support. Hope it helps. / I'm slipping back again and there is nothing / I can do about it.
Just woke up / afternoon pines / Playing the wind
There are seven habits of highly effective people / I can't even get out of bed on time / There are seven habits of highly effective people / Getting drunk on your lunch break isn't one of them
I mean, I really- / Just seeing you happy / Made summer better.
Blowing in an afternoon wind, / on a white fence, / A cobweb
than to reveal her contents / for all of God's creatures to revel in. / So I broke her waxed seal / and climbed inside her language. / I parted the clouds
you stand inside me naked infinite love / the dawn bell rips my dreaming heart
and suddenly everything that once was sweet / is now clingy / and the only way to win / is to admit defeat
You (never) hurt me too. / (I don't know why) / I'm doing this. / (I'm sorry.)
and i will grow free and strong / and start a new life / one i do not wish to leave
For though I have long drowned  / my eyes and ears have fallen  / on such creatures and sounds  / of intrigue and and color; blues and browns.
Morning sun / The purple petals, / Four have fallen
I never worried  / about the Sun in Sacramento  / I knew it was there  / and somehow knew / it would always  / be waiting / if I ever came back.
Cold crisp October morning / the cats fighting / In the weeds
pine needles inches deep hug the ground / no one lives here
Surprising cat fight / in the parlor on a / Blustery September night
My girlfriend took a train / To go to the St. Patrick's Day Parade  / With another man.
My rumpled couch / The lady's voice / Next door
ago
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief. / My assumption of the child’s health turned out to be quite brief. / Her condition cut the odds[of a successful birth] percent-wise down to twenty  / But twenty’s really not so bad – like two flips of a penny.
and a macbook / and go to starbucks / and i will write poetry / and it will be poetic
why do you think she cut her hair  / how do her purple highlights always end up in your sleeves  / why do you hold them to the light every time you find one  / don’t you know by now
what color were her eyes
Listen to the birds sing! / All the little birds / Will die!

oh yes things exist like the echo when you yell at the foot of a / huge mountain
I found my love in trailers small  / in graphite shapes, in teacher's call  / in paper, lined both blue and straight - / and I rejoice, to pass her gate.
and text you / where is my phone / can you call / it can you call me / can you hear me can / you tell by the longitude / of my lexicon that our
I'll make you understand that when you kissed me behind my ear and we said our goodbyes, I felt a lump in my throat and the beginnings of a chronic homesickness
Ignoring my bread, / the bird peeking / In the grass
Frightened, I turned homeward. Home! / I cried out someone's name... / But both my shoes made hollow noise. / Without echoes. All the same.
The cows of Autumn / laughing along the fence, / Roosters at Dawn
Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation? / My body overtook my mind / We broke the promise to stay just friends / and for the first time in a long time I didn't care / I guess I didn't care too much / Because I didn't bother asking if / You were still hers.
Velvet horses / in the valley auction / Woman sings

I don’t care / the low yellow / Moon loves me
Autumn night stove / I’ve never been / on a farm before.
Under that neon lamplight, mothers bring their children to the flies, like a baptism for the dead; / The children shove their faces into the gas station windows, or else watch the backs of their fathers / Who look onto their land, its illimitable suffering, and roll it up into suicide cigars.
and i would keep riding on as a grinning skeleton / and people would stare and mutter incredulously under their breath and go to work confused or maybe call in sick and go home and lie down on their couches and wonder if they were become senile or contracting some early form of dementia
Cool breeze maybe / just a shillyshallying snow / That'll ruin everything
In the desert sun / in Arizona, / A yellow railroad caboose
There is nothing to comfort you / Except the silence of old graves  / And if you try to listen  / You will hear the sound of things falling.

I like to save a little space for all my favourite songs  / like “In the Mood,” and “Cross Road Blues,” or “Where my heart belongs.” / I also like to save some room for Riddles to recite  / that way I can solve them quick so others think I’m bright.
How will I know if Wellbutrin is working? / I stopped feeling bad. / Life is just whatever. / Without my negativity / I feel like I don't have any drive.

I found my sparrow Sonrin dead one morning / and buried him just as gently as I would my own daughter
THE LIGHT BULB / SUDDENLY WENT OUT / STOPPED READING
I found my love in warm caress  / in ordered print, in puzzle's mess  / in lightning bright and thunder loud - / the more I learn, the more I'm proud.
I wrote a hundred songs / And all of them are gone.
Aurora borealis / over Mount Hozomeen / The world is eternal
Made hot cocoa / at night, / Sang by woodfire
I don’t know why you always do this
Blizzard in the suburbs / the mailman / And the poet walking
to applaud the clear complexion of my face. / So I stow away & abort this cavalcade. / Immediately before I espied a fable’s end / All because…
Winter – that / sparrow’s nest / Still empty

The fly, just as / lonesome as I am / In this empty house
"You and me" / I sang / Looking at the cemetery
peace isn't luck for six years stand facing a silent wall / until the you of your face melts like a candle
Huge knot in the / Redwood tree / Looking like Zeus’ face
Six months go by and by and you pull right over my heart / You had me at hello, we both knew that from the start / You needed help with money, asked me "can you sign my card?" / So I took it and signed my name.
i am opening my eyes / i am smiling  / the grille of the truck is smiling back / things could have been worse
The jazz trombone, / The moving curtain, / Spring rain

They say things like "Good Morning," they smile. They leave a tip. / She says things like "the usual?" and "Have a nice day!".
I'd sniff you like a dog and taste you / then kiss your other mouth endlessly if I could white hair or not
Teetering on the brink / I crawl on all fours / Down the endless hallway / Closing any open doors
amazingly sad how its blade mirrors the years / how sadness extends far as the hills and rivers
Okay, no bed... / I feel warm fingers / Of copper carpet  / Massaging my bare breasts
lone moon no clouds / we stumble through the night
smoke / milky incandescent nebulas / breathed by dusty lungs. / but the black in between— / it is time / love / possibility
August in Salinas / Autumn leaves in / Clothing store displays
Having a hard time eating / i think i'm going to start drinking
Misurgirafical & plomlied / ding dang / The Buddha’s gang

I'd ask him if diseases and natural disasters were really necessary / I'd ask him where in this "master plan" he managed to fit racism and hatred / I'd remind him of the massacres in his name / I'd remind him of the Crusades, people set aflame because their faith was different

I'd ask him if those spiteful lines of scripture on those angry peoples picket signs actually mean anything / I wonder if those bible verses were meant to sound so violent / I'd ask him if what they're saying is true because if it is, your unconditional love comes with an unconventional contract / I'd ask him "how can you be all loving with so many exceptions to your own rules?"
Fuck a love poem
Autumn eve – my / mother playing old / Love songs on the piano
Mist before the peak / the dream / Goes on
Sweet sorrow / hello again
might not be so sad like a horse in a  / stable that is waiting to die with his / best years behind him and he  / can't remember what they were and i
The little sparrow on the eave drainpipe / My heart flutters
Her happy carefree spirit was like / The sun lighting a room
Some trees still / have naked winter look / Spring day
my heart was swollen / and I was drunk / and didn’t cry / until you fell asleep.
Here comes / My dragon / goodbye!
He’s not broken yet / But he can’t forget / How he pushed all of his loved ones away
Mild spring night / a teenage girl said / "Good evening" in the dark
"Woo!" – bird of perfect / balance on the fir / Just moved his tail
a flower held up twirled between human fingers / a smile barely visible
Halloween colors / orange and black / On a summer butterfly
The first date that we had was in a diner on a hill / You texted me and said "at 8?" I said "ok I will" / We talked and laughed and afterwards I said I'll take the bill / So I took it and signed my name.
I cannot help but have it myself / you see  / I know that smile / And throughout the days
It thrummed inside its little jail / And buzzed and murmured too. / And twixt my fingertips, I watched / To see what it would do.
Great like a home-cooked meal at six / Respect for your elders / And actual conversation. / Great like homecoming dances / And the national anthem;
Bluejay drinking at my / saucer of milk, / Throwing his head back
Four in morning / creak my mother / In her bed
So on some cool fall nights  / when my eyes tire from the glow of screens
Someday I'll tell you a funny story / About how getting lost with you one afternoon made me feel like I was exactly where I needed to be / That when you held me and eased my childish fears after a long night of drinking, it felt like love / And when I woke to find you asleep a full 12 inches away, I wished it was a different kind of love
(you haven't taken a shower in three days) / i rub my nipples when i masturbate sometimes  / (filthy)
Nope / Not my problem.  / You need consciousness  / To feel  / To read all of this.
The forecast said clear skies  / But there's 100% chance of rain / north of my heart, tonight.
True love is not found  / It lies in your heart.  / We search for an end  / Which we had at the start.
Dusk now – / what’s left of / An ancient pier
The Angel’s hair / trailed on my chin / Like a cobweb
when i was done talking  / and crying  / We sat in  / perfect / silence.
Dawn, a falling star / A dewdrop lands / On my head!
Drunk as a hoot owl / writing letters / By thunderstorm
one pause between each crow's / reckless shriek Ikkyū Ikkyū Ikkyū
The wind sent / a leaf on / the robin’s back
Two clouds kissing / backed up to look / At each other
And life  / this life  / from its turbid view  / through blemished glass -
then i woke up and my brain was screaming the word 'fuck' in a very monotonous and half-heartedly drawn out way / it was going
you were the sea / and i was underneath you
Too hot to write / haiku – crickets / and mosquitoes
I am lying in a pool of your slowly coagulating blood / cracks and snaps of malice kick up small puffs of dust around me / I hear nothing but the steady rhythm of my machine gun / "die motherfucker, die" / Its been 3 hours since you died
Blizzard in the suburbs / old man driving slowly / To the store 3 blocks
don’t worry  / i liked it.
We were best friends / Inseparable. / When only one of us is out, they would ask about the missing half. / We spent an unhealthy amount of time together. / Just / New friends / Passing time.
Insolvent with the dopeman  / So, weigh the love, buy a gram. / Spent more than 100 grand ($) / On a 15 year old addiction.
deserve to live and die alone without / joy or pleasure in my / days and the sun is coming up soon but / i can't seem to fall asleep because i can't stop / worrying about where my life is and is not
My cat’s asleep / poor little angel, / the burden of flesh!
two in the morning
dry, skeleton stalks in gooseflesh Autumn fields  / ribcage falling as he exhales, as his heart pumps blood into breath into life
we spend our saturdays watching cartoons  / or rather, the cartoonish way everything seems to move  / flashes and glitches like bad programming.
Of greed, overflown. / Great like the astral aspirations / Of an entire generation / And a race / to the stars.
This plane is starting to / Tailspin / This plane / This gas mask / The clouds / Falling / Falling / Falling
night after night after night stay up all night / nothing but your own night
I tie the noose as I lose hope / Still hanging on, but by a rope
Ancient ancient world / tight skirts / By the new car
Racing westward through / the clouds in the howling / wind, the moon
Via proviso and prominence  / videotape the effervescent spheres' / kismet as they ski / upwards like fractured dagger tips / to compose a paved entryway / atop the crest of the Raduga K-8.
Train tunnel, too dark / for me to write: that / "Men are ignorant"
Do they still have mornings / in Sacramento? / Will I be able to have  / and feel / a slow time, bright / and mine
Everything was silent / Delights and ends / Everything violent / You left a note / Right by the bed
forget what the masters wrote truth's a razor / each instant sitting here you and I being here
Rain’s over, hammer on wood / this cobweb / Rides the sun shine
I guess I drank too much again. / Alone. / Need to get out. / I don't want to go. / The world always wants to remind me / I'm inferior.  / I want to leave it all behind.
into the far corners of the galaxy  / so I can join her forever / in the heavens.
A million acres / of Bo-trees / And not one Buddha
Mists blew by, I / Closed my eyes, / Stove did the talking
I know that smile / I know what it means / I am aware of the nervousness / that comes along with it
she bit her lip. "i haven't," she lied / and left through the fire exit.
Two cars passing / on the freeway / Husband and wife
Happiness: clothing  / Worn for others approval  / Comes off when alone
break open the cherry tree where's the flower? / but spring
Nightfall, / boy smashing dandelions / with a stick
Or, walking the same or different / paths / The moon follows each
but now as I am staring down death himself / who commissioned the hate of an entire country to do his work / I miss your gunfire more than I miss you
my gray cat jumped up just as I lifted this spoon / we're born we die
One day I met upon my way / A lovely fox who pranced and played  / In quiet awe I ceased my stride / She stopped as well but did not hide  / Her eyes I held and hers did mine; / So saw the fox and I.
Drinking wine / the Queen of Greece / on a postage stamp
flowers are silent silence is silent the mind / is a silent flower the silent flower of the world opens
I’m up here in the hills starving myself / but I’ll come down for you
one white blossom snow / razor-edged mountains slice my belly
no walls no roof no anything my house / doesn't get wet doesn't get blown down
Me, my pipe, / my folded legs / Far from Buddha
Autumn nite / Lucien’s wife / Playing the guitar
Late afternoon – / it’s not the void / That changed
Man dying / Harbor lights / On still water
Sunday in a bar / in Woodland Calif. / One noon beer
and snuck out to the hudson / and threw them in the river / and missed / and felt very dumb and unmovie-like
And now he can tell / That in this living hell / That he’d wishes he’d just let them stay
clouds very high look / not one word helped them get up there
Is this the land of great resource be found? / How tall the pines and strong the maples rise  / O'er fields of grains that moor the fertile ground  / And mighty mountains pierce the western skies. / . / Oh, should we place a thousand ships to sea  / To cast their nets and pluck the endless cod  / The salty depths would still more gracious be  / Till pious men fatigue the ears of God. / . / But blessed lands repay with blood from men  / Oh how their lustful yearnings must be filled. / They turn their might to loose the sword again  / And blight the land as blood and tears are spilled. / . / The rightful heirs have paid for hallowed lands  / And mourn for us the blood still on our hands.
i keep in my pocket / dances on my fingers / as i watch you / play with your hair / i do not think you see me
The vigorous bell-ringing priest / the catch in the harbor
Buddhas in moonlight / Mosquito bite / thru hole in my shirt
So I rosin my bow and I join in the show / And I sing to the moon and the stars  / But no fiddle can play in the rapturous way / Of that gypsy’s sweet Spanish Guitar.
eat the wind eat the water nobody can say how / I know a man who stood twenty years on Gojo bridge
And a new bag of mixed tricks / That will get me to where  / My next destination lives. / Perched way up high / In the mountains.
Sleeping on my desk / head on the sutras, / my cat
You are beautiful / And I hate that I love to love you / The mere sight of you makes my heart pound / Pumping hot blood that burns through my veins
The shame / of wanting to fuck the therapist, because sex / is the only thing that makes me feel anymore
Before you were born / Remember anything? / calm down  / It's the same thing
For a moment / the moon / Wore goggles
even before trees rocks I was nothing / when I'm dead nowhere I'll be nothing
Hell-bent for treasures of skin  / New faces and old fetishes. / Tongue in cheek, words of mouth  / Often to leave the lips
cut off everything from everything stand here the soles of your feet the ground / your brain in the black nothing between
oh the evening wind hurries smoke our smoke / into the sky
I hear the swing, reminds me of summer / I used to push you on a seat of rubber / The grins you used to give your mother / The creak back and forth hitting the lumber
Great again like the good ol’ days / Of white picket fences, made in the U.S.A. / And white picket neighbours who were as well. / Great like nuclear families / With Nuclear dreams
we wonder if our parents ever felt this way  / chests bursting with a hopeful less-feeling / because the night sky says what we can't figure out how to phrase  / and a fifth of fireball says what we can't bring ourselves to say
you don't think about me even though i think about you  / you have lots of new friends  / meanwhile i am lonely and scared and sad and i have no new friends  / i don't think we were ever friends  / i hope you get fatal amphetamine poisoning  / you cunt
She told me that all bad people are just good people on a strange path  / and all the saints are just secret keeping sinners, or mediocre folks / who never woke up on the odd side of the road: / Exceptional Evil is only the bedfellow of Ghandian Greatness. / I told her the saints had been such selfish lovers lately. / She said, you’ve got two hands  / do it yourself.
A yellow witch chewing / a cigarette, / Those Autumn leaves
Autumnal cowflops / a man / Makes a living.
age eighty weak / I shit and offer it to Buddha
watching my four-year-old daughter dance / I can't break free of her
And time  / our time  / seems little more  / than a shifting shape / in swirling smoke.
The Golden Gate / creaks / With sunset rust
Second thundershower / over – the sun / Is still high
and i will not be depressed / i will be confident and strong and happy / i will finally live my life
This is my poem to a girl in my class / Who sits and listens with such passionate interest / Overtaken by shyness she never participates / She reads her poetry book and takes notes on her favorites / The person I want to be is shown through her intelligence
My Japanese blinds / are down / I’m reading about Ethiopia
Great again. / Great like ball games / And road trips  / American flags / And church potlucks.
Sometimes I'm scared of fear because I know it's in my head  / And my head's a place of dissonance where lonely thoughts are fed / The things I do to feel alive make me wish that I were dead / I'm just a careless keeper of all the words I've never said
In Hakkaido a cat / has no luck
How flowers love / the sun, / Blinking there!
The gently moving / leaves / Of the August afternoon
These thoughts slither around in my brain like a snake / Eating away at my will to get through each day / Eating away any thoughts of resolution / My mind is polluted / Like the air in my city
religions and it was so real life / that it cant possibly leave my / mind now bc I cant make memories / like that anymore when I’m trying / so hard to make memories like that
It's been years. / We see each other at the store. / One of us is just back to visit parents / They're getting older / Sometimes they ask about you. / How old is the baby? / Seven. We're headed to see their / New friends / Passing time.
A year goes by and for a time I really felt at peace / You took me to your parents and I met your aunt and niece / So then you took me by the hand, said "you should sign this lease" / So I took it and signed my name.
So I bite my tongue / And grate my teeth / Because I know underneath / the cleverly constructed guise / lies a beast / And within me  / the power to arrive at a future much better  / and in you  / terrible; down to the letter.
The son who wants solitude, / Enveloped / In his room
Breakfast done / the tomcat curls up / On the down couch
Two ants hurry / to catch up / With lonely Joe
The white chair is / holding its arms out / to Heaven dandelions
M’ugly spine – the loss / of the kingdom / Of Heaven
And though I tie and hope to die, I will hang on until you're gone. / I will wait patient for the dawn, the mast has fallen through the deck, the water rises to my neck.
Sun on the rocks / a fighting snag / Holds on
The vile fish falls and lets out a hiss / As it heaves like a squashed cat  / Its life expunged. / There’s nothing I can do anyways.
Walking down the road/a crushed snake. / autumn / Red trees -
when I was forty-seven everybody came to see me / so I walked out forever
sutras poems I stash them under my robe burn them all / but not words written on my heart
so i knew it was very serious / he made me feel bad about myself  / which is ironic because that's exactly why i started doing drugs in the first place / to get a few hours of relief
Let them come again in force  / To see the fallen in our eyes. / Let them cower in retreat, knowing  / That a martyr never dies.
Nodding against the wall, / the flowers / Sneeze
May grass / Nothing much / To do
and sometimes there is chaos, within our ranks / we hash things out with facebook and fists / and soldiers have fallen, but we will not forget / bong rips for frankie, give 'em hell kid.
Walking with the dog on the road / a crooked leaf.
Wish I were a rooster / and leave my sperm / On the sidewalk, shining!
I said a joke / under the stars / No laughter
Prayerbeads / on the Holy Book / My knees are cold
The cat musing / along the ground / cold gray day
On the sidewalk / A dead baby bird / For the ants
The smiling fish / where are they, / Scouting bird?
we cut class like the valentines we made in first grade  / decisive but clumsy, eager to learn, and with emotion / spray paint in place of quills, so we can transcribe our novellas / on a broke city's tunnels and halls
or “the dark pit or remembrance” / pretty deep stuff, I know. / Last night I was up late
He put on his shoes and buttoned his buttons / And scratched at his labrador’s ear / Then lowered his head and stepped into winter / That Thursday of his forty third year
Hurrying things along, / Autumn rain / On my awning
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fyi i am  / typing these out individually and not copy pasting fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Sometimes / it feels like my hands will never stop shaking / and my words will never land gracefully  / but instead fall like glass / to shatter on the floor / in a stuttering apology / because I don’t know what else to say or do
I think our minds, like many things, are limited in space  / our thoughts and things we like to know all need their proper place. / Although our minds are vastly wide, they really aren’t that deep / so we must choose from what must go and what we want to keep.
So humid you cant / light matches, like / Living in a tank
i am standing in my room with the lights off holding an empty glass of water in one hand / my brain is saying, 'you will live and die alone'
The moon / is a / Blind lemon
blissfully out of my own mind and / This morning I awoke to find / a text from myself that read:
Do I have an intellectual disability? / I have no idea what to do. / I think I'm dumb. / I don't know how to deal with this.
But then somehwere down the line / My mind ignored the clues
O Sebastian, where art thou? / Pa, watch over us! / Saints, thank you!
Sometimes / I want to lay in be all day / staring up at the ceiling / with the same sad song playing on repeat / and without brushing my hair once / because it takes so much energy to move
I reached for my pack  / of reds  / but then I remembered I quit  / awhile  / ago
I’ve turned up / the lamp again / The sleeping moth
we're lost where the mind can't find us / utterly lost
The shame / The shame, the shame of it all tore / me to bits and the next hours blurred
Reading my notes / The fly stepping from / The page to the finger
Silent pipe / peace and quiet / In my heart
Looking up to see / the airplane / I only saw the TV aerial
Flowers / aim crookedly / At the straight death
Her good intentions also turned my love into a liar. / She told me that she left me not because she lost desire  / But because she wanted me to have some freedom and be happy. / I believed her, really just because I wanted to so badly. / I was happy at this point, although my freedom was subdued… / We said goodnight, and that was that. Forward a day or two
I rocked up at His place  / dressed up  / but sobered down  / and we talked on the couch.
horseshit  / but when I told Her I loved her  / She just said  / that’s so very nice to  / hear

and heck isn’t scary if we / both go itll be like doing / drugs when my mom wasn’t / home in the garage we invented
the first thing you will think of will be her shoulder blades / and how they responded in unison to each meticulous / heave and sigh that left her lips / you will stare at the ceiling and think about / how too many times you let / yourself win in an argument.
Fuck a love poem / It's easy to do when you're enamored
trying to quit. The beer is a cold / bastard. I cried tonight. The  / beer doesn’t miss my friend / who jumped to his death last / month. I do. Every day. The
I don't know. / I feel like everyone hates me... and I'm just someone people "deal with". / Dependent.
no words sitting alone night in my hut eyes closed hands open / wisps of an unknown face
The rush that you provide is always knocking at my door. / You batter and demean me, but I find I'm craving more. / My sanctuary now is the opaqueness of my mind. / I'll leave you when I need to, but for now I'm doing fine.
she stole some pills from her sister / and we never really slept  / just fell on top of each other in whichever / room we had torn apart last.
Buddha laughing / on Mt. Lanka! / Like Jimmy Durante!
"Watch where you're going, you just almost ran over that / Mexican lady and made me spill your... quinoa... you faggot." / I nod. / I miss the turn a minute later.
Alone at home reading / Yoka Daishi, / Drinking tea
I'd give anything: / My bicycle / Ten years / A rib
and the nights inside you rocking / smelling the odor of your thighs is everything
As a woman, in her mid-30s  / Blonde hair, pony tail, yoga pants  / Bends over to tie the shoes of her obviously autistic son. / ' / "Yeah man, nice." I say as I try to find my way back / To my familiar, cozy, melancholy haze / "It's just this place, is just fucking loaded with talent, dude." / "There's the yoga place, right next door." / "And like, only chicks who care about their appearance come / here, right?" / ' / Looking into the cereal aisle, Johnny continues  / "I should apply here. It's probably less money than Mack Shack  / but Jeeezus Christ, look at all this talent." / The woman in front of us struggles with the weight of her / bags
“Are you asleep?” / “No” / “Did I pass out?” / “Yes” / “Are you ok?” / “Yes” / “I’m sorry” / I’m not sorry / “It’s fine” / It’s not
Waving goodbye, / the little girl, / Backing up
It’s 5:30 / Too early for me / But now I can’t sleep / I have to pee / I’m thirsty / Thirsty / Always thirsty
Replay the tapes / Sponsored by NannyCam / Caught up in some / Jared Fogel scam. / Residue still on my hands / More than enough for a conviction.

I love bamboo how it looks / and because men carve it into flutes
Another night wasted on a girl with no name  / the affection was real, but just not the same. / The walk home will be long, but he takes it slow  / as his house is not home he'd rather not go.

Autumn night / Salvation Army sign / On a cold brick building
Why doesn't depression hurt anymore? / I may have forgotten what happiness is.
Oh moon, / such dismay? / Earths betray
I love taking my new girl blind Mori on a spring picnic / I love seeing her exquisite free face its moist sexual heat shine

Night fall too dark / to read the page, / Too dark
Why explain? / bear burdens / In silence
My friend standing / in my bedroom / The spring rain
When the moon sinks / down to the power line, / I'll go in
Is this depression? / Is this ever going to get better? / As if people care.
How that butterfly’ll wake up / When someone / Bongs that bell!
Gray spring rain / I never clipped / My hedges 
Everything is worse at night. / I don't kill myself for the same reasons I want to.
He stood falling, flailing, endlessly / He'd always been alone / He knew what he had said was false / His heart had turned to stone.
My blue spruce / in the pale / Haze dusk
Iowa clouds / following each other / Into Eternity
Not long after we'd met / You'd listened to them all.

today I finally told her  / in rain-padded silence we walked to my apartment  / murky New York sky a black shelter above us / void of stars, filled with lights
That one day you just realize you are an adult  / And you go to work and you go to the store  / And you see all of these people despairingly disconnected  / Desolately walled off
I sat right here, looked in that mirror / and had a slightly rounder face  / because when I was here five weeks ago / I was in a different place.
Bred to rejoice, / the giggling / sunshine leaves
If you invite a poet into your bed, She’ll carve stars into your palms So that every caress of yours Paints constellations across her skin. Complex enough to make an astronomer leap across her body
Those birds sitting / out there on the fence / They're all going to die.
Somebody rang my bell / I said who? / O it doesn’t worldly care
The way she rolls her ankle / In her white high-top Converse
The meadow grass waved / to the whim of the breeze; / Those shooting stars fell to the will of black seas. / But I and the moonlight  / ’Til nighttime had passed  / Just sat there alone in that sweet meadow grass.
"Perhaps she loves him for his charming wit  / Or maybe it's his roguish handsome smile / That hangs upon his body, trim and fit  / With stately clothes of elegance and style."
One flower / on the cliffside / Nodding at the canyon
Love is a subtle thing. / The sound of your barefoot feet  / the quick glance and little smile. / The way you say my name  / Your way.
“And when you can finally read the writing on the wall  / When you see that your dreams are nothing at all  / When you arise with tears already in your eyes  / That’s how you’ll know.”
The sleeping moth / he doesn’t know / The lamps turned up again
Blueberry dubbery / the chipmunk’s / In the grass
to see the sunshine / and for me to gaze upon your faces / but i never told you any of that / who pretends / to put people
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief. / My optimistic hope had gone, replaced with sorrow, grief. / Her heart was fine, but in her there was one heartbeat too few. / Our little angel was just that; worse still, I lost not one but two.
Blizzard’s just started / all that bread scattered, / And just one bird
We are a new generation of writers.  / We traded Hemingway’s whiskey / for Red Bull and Vodka
Dusk in the holy / woods / Dust on my window
Indeed there's no end.  / That's the trick of the maze.  / It seems we've been lied to  / By the stories and plays.
I found my love in raven's wings  / in orange embers, in secret things  / in air's caress and quiet earth - / the catalysts of my rebirth.
I found my / cat one / Silent star
one of you saved my satori paper I know it piece by piece you / pasted it back together now watch me burn it once and for all
Leaves falling everywhere / in the November / Midnight moonshine
The sight of you left me gasping for air / The way you smile, the way you glare / Back when I didn’t know what you had in store / To hurt me more / Hurt me more
I dun – I dunno either baby...
I'd ask him why some kids have to grow up without parents at all / If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him if there was a "plan b" / Because obviously "plan g-o-d" isn't working
candy wrappers / until you had warmed to my touch / i would let you out / sometimes
(in hopes of reconnecting to the / emotions we lost in the digital abyss).
It’s been so long since I’ve been afflicted / I think the pain somehow got me addicted / So even though we’ve done this before / Hurt me more / Hurt me more
I called Hanshan / in the fog / Silence, it said
Taghagata [=Tathagata] neither loathes / nor loves / His body’s milk or shit
“When you hold the knife  / And your mind wanders to ending your life. / When you grow accustomed to it  / That’s how you’ll know.
Looking up at the stars, / feeling sad, / Going "tsk tsk tsk" 
On different paths we were / You and I / Crossing for a time too short.
Missing a kick / at the icebox door / It closed anyway
Back on XANAX and Lexapro. / Not making progress, running out of options. / I'm scared that I've hit a really low point in my life, with no way to climb back up.
I have not heard from her now / For years on end
but very recently I’ve / come to the realization / that the number of people we meet / in this world isn’t nearly
she said oh sorry oh sorry sorry sorry!  / you know how I get  / when I get drunk.
Mule on the seashore / One thousand foot / Bridge above
only one koan matters / you
But since that’s all I am / I was never untrue / Lovely limbs and flushed cheeks / Quick wit, hopes and dreams
Summer afternoon / impatiently chewing / The jasmine leaf
We went to the bar later that night. / Johnny killed it with every girl he talked to. / It was really an amazing thing to watch. / I sat on my stool and barely blinked as the whiskey seemed to refill itself.
I called Hanshan / in the mountains / there was no answer
On Desolation / I was the alonest man / in the world
Spring night / the silence / Of the stars
that is so often forgiven as / eccentricity / i say  / “none of them.” / for the stars are mere markers
why is it all so beautiful this fake dream / this craziness why?
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck my k key is sticky and annoying fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck  / fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck it just occured to me how insane it is to be repeatedly typing 'fuck' into a notepad  / file at two in the morning fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck this is taking longer than i
She’s here now, she’s arrived and she’s staying because she is molasses and i’m vinegar at best.
i checked again—the lump's still there  / (a manly way to go) / can men even get breast cancer?  / (why are you grabbing your manboob in the first place?) / i was soaping it in the shower
My critics jiggle / constantly like / Poison ivy in the rain
Tuesday one more / drop of rain / From my roof
Lexapro? / Zoloft? / Should I expect more side effects? / Please help
i hope things will get better for us someday / me and you / happy / together / in the inarticulable future / please do not lose hope
Dependent and lovesick  / Strung out on a quick fix. / These ideals keep us lifted  / In a smoke cloud, persistent. / Fucking with the same shit;
I told myself this wasn’t fair / While you sat there playing with your hair / I thought I felt better calling you a whore / But it hurt me more / Hurt me more
And it comes back and through and over you, the feeling of despair. / I try to plead with you and breathe for you but gasp I do for air
Walking down the road with dog / a crushed leaf
My hand, / A thing with hairs, / rising and falling with my belly
A little later I poured  / a drink  / but then I remembered I sobered up  / a couple months  / ago
Resting watchfully, the cat / and the squirrel / Share the afternoon
But everyone keeps saying you have a plan / If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him what that "plan" was / Because I hear a lot of people talking about it
But to avoid melodrama  / and an uncomfortable silence  / I’ll bite it back and say  / “I’m doing okay.”  / Yeah  / I’m doing just fine.
Walking over the water / my shadow, / Heavier than lead
something in us always wants to cry out / someone we love knows hears
Grain Elevators on / Saturday waiting for / The farmers to come home

We all order double americanos. / (So predictable!) / We all eat the fresh pastries. / (How cliché!) / We write all poems about The Coffeeshop Girl. / (He's probably just like the rest...)
there is this little man in my chest cavity / he is wearing a little hardhat and has little workboots on / in his left hand he holds a little pickaxe  / his job is really simple
And just like my city / I want your pity / But not your solutions / Because I rely on my pollutants
It’s (not) your fault. / I want to start off / By letting you know that / It’s (not) / You. / (It’s me.)
Before I left for university she finally said it: / “I’m breaking up with you” in no uncertain terms; I read it / From my phone through tears, asked why, but deep down knew the point was moot. / I lost my heart that dreadful day, and lost my mind to boot.
Spring night / the neighbor hammering / In the new old house
you won't even be here to read them / what stupidity to put these words into your mouth
Autumn night in New Haven / the Whippenpoofers / Singing on the train
At night / The girl I denied / Walking away
Looking around to think / I saw the thick white cloud / Above the house
The days go / They cant stay / I don’t realize
this world this thing you and I call knowing / those ten words these fifty-four-year-old fingers are everything
brush ink plunge forward blind man who knows each step in the dark / the bristles dry dip again brush blind until you’re gone

everyone who wants / to be in it to little spoon / me if they don’t lie to / me I will like their band / a lot and go to all their shows / and when they do witchcraft / I will profess that I am hexed
Not from her touch but cool air coming through my open window. / And I remember / The only constant in life is change.
I am the discovered girl  / a marionette who cut her strings.  / A continent, pristine and pure  / unclaimed by concrete queens and kings.
Girl trapped beneath the / steering wheel, beautiful / As the Dalai Lama’s dream

Summer night / I put out / The empty milk bottle
If ten thousand hours / turns man to master  / then I am Lord / of imagined loves / and ever-afters
Postmodern poets  / pontificating profusely
Autumn nite / my mother cuts her throat
They all want to tell me about their Stuff  / how they used to have so much / but now they just want to go fishing
The mirror wept, cause / everyone who looked at her / saw only themselves.
November the seventh / The last / Faint cricket
First December cold / wave not even / One cricket
Stars shine brighter / When you're dying
it's not as scary as i thought it would be  / (you'd never have to figure out how the hell a 401k works) / impending death would make my conversations more interesting.  / (never have to get that lumpy body in shape)
Waiting with me for / the end of this ephemeral / Existence – the moon
a woman is enlightenment when you're with her and the red thread / of both your passions flare inside you and you see
from my girlfriend’s thanksgiving. / They didn’t make a lot of vegan / food. I care. The beer doesn’t. / The beer smokes cigarettes. I’m
The housecats, amazed / at something new, / Looking in the same direction
The full moon / the cat gone / My sleeping mother
I know there are trees  / cause I've been before  / and remember / the river / and floating cotton in the air.

Whatever it is, I quit / now I'll let my / breath out –
A bird pecking kernels / on a grassy hillside / Just mowed
Vigorous Springfields / Speak their stories of sorrow. / They tell of martyrs they've made / In the past, present, and tomorrow.
The first time that I saw you, I was stuck in states of wonder  / I walked up to you seat and told you that you were a stunner / You smiled and gave a napkin and said "you should write your number" / So I took it and signed my name.
The girls that spiral into my life / Come with little invitation / More like, with no invitation / They find me, part the curtains and enter
And you can bet I'd be willing / To take the grimy, soggy train tickets I crumpled in my fist as we ran through the sweaty pink evening just in time to miss the train  / Cover them with orange blossom tea dregs  / Make a sacrifice and summon the gods responsible / For Sunday coming after Saturday and you leaving for school on Monday / And for this lonely fall.
It’s as if the sun and the horizon met and set in your eyes.  / If your feet ever touched the floor, i find the sky would grow unbearably jealous of the earth
Bee, why are you / staring at me? / I'm not a flower!
The son packs / quietly as the / Mother sleeps
Run over my lawnmower, / waiting for me to leave, / The frog
and I have yet to come to terms with it / you are still at my side / arms splayed out at an awkward angle / head tilted unnaturally to the side
The ant struggles escaping / from the web / The spider’s non-comment
dusted the platter / i set a new table  / comfortably / for myself inside of my head
who brought these fish sizzling in the pan I’ll never stop thinking / about women white hair lust sings through my body weeds everywhere
He leaned in and He told me  / i have the saddest eyes he’s seen  / and i pushed him away  / because i couldn’t  / make love to a  / darren
because I knew it was just alcohol and loneliness / but my god, I’ll never forget your hand on the back of my neck / and the love story your tongue told mine
I take a pen and a leather bound book  / pour a glass of fine bourbon  / buy a pack of the strongest cigarettes
Close your eyes / Landlord knocking / On the back door
I walk home / fighting the crisp autumn air  / and make myself toast  / in an empty kitchen  / and hit my head / on an open  / cupboard  / and all I can see are stars.
Moon behind / Black clouds / Silver seas
The castle of the Gandharvas / is full of aging / Young couples
i want to get away from here / just up and leave one day / with a bag of clothes and some money / maybe a toothbrush, too / maybe not
heartfelt facebook messenger conversation close to midnight but not quite
Snap your finger / stop the world! / Rain falls harder
Night rain – neighbors / Arguing loud voices / In next house
I'm the friend that walks behind when the sidewalk won't fit three / I'm the burnt out light house bulb that keeps the sailor out at sea / The things I do to feel alive just end up hurting me / And my mind's the only place in which only I can be
empty belly no wine it's freezing / melody the angel's shining cloak stains the air
sick all I can think of is love and fucking the love song / hums in my groin listen my hair’s white wild grasses uncut on my meadow
White-walled wheels / Before Detroit / Became a punchline.
—But you aren't mine either. / And maybe you never will be. / Maybe you're only using me, but I need you to hear this: / I know I'm nothing to you but / You make me feel alive / Even if it's all a lie.
Girls' footprints / in the sand / Old mossy pile
And I don't ever want to wake up.
The little sparrow / on my eave drainpipe / Is looking around
The storm, / like Dostoevsky / Builds up as it lists
Cool breezy morning / the cat is rolling / On his back
A quiet moment / low lamp, low logs / Just cooking the stew
In the chair / I decided to call Haiku / By the name of Pop
Full moon in the trees / across the street, / the jail
like watching a man walk out of a grocery store / with one rose in his hand and wondering / what it’s for—a contrition or a gravestone / or just because. this is just because.
The book / stands all by itself / on the shelf
Sometimes / I can’t tear my eyes away / from the razor in the medicine cabinet / and all I can see is crimson running down my ankles / and pooling on the bathroom tile / until I force myself to remember / that it’s not an option anymore
But I still remember you  / blood beading on your forearms from the time you climbed that tree / whose trunk was thick as the words which had caught in your throat / and you could barely manage to grip its sides.
A black bull / and a white bird / Standing together on the shore
burning inside my heart  / And left Me to think about how it felt / to fall asleep in someone’s arms  / and wake up a completely different
Thanks to Coolidge, / Hoover – Hoover – but Autumn, / Roosevelt done America in
flute notes bring gods demons only that music / again the world's biggest ass-man hasn't one friend / his loneliness that music
After the shower, / among the drenched roses, / the bird thrashing in the bath
A bottle of wine, / a bishop / Everything is God
Hand in hand in a red valley / with the universal schoolteacher / the first morning
The red roof of the barn / is ravelled / Like familiar meat
Beautiful young girls running / up the library steps / With shorts on
To the top of the dive / "Me first!" you yelled / As you pushed me aside / I lost my balance / And fell off too
every day i tell myself this / and every day i am disappointed  / i am such a fucking liar / 
These little gray sparrows on the roof / I’ll shot my editor
The barn, swimming / in a sea / Of windblown leaves
Financially we would be fucked, but that was fine with me. / My mind instead dwelled on togetherness and family. / (Her arm’s glass tube had broken - in effect was ineffective  / The doctor failed, but my subconscious finished its objective)
I don’t mind;
in a dazzling scabbard / this wooden sword / which can't kill or help you to live
And you want to be on the other side  / So your nail scrapes the skin  / And there is an exhalation of vapor  / A burst of luminous droplets

What is Buddhism? / A crazy little / Bird blub
I saw her five minutes before, carefully studying the ingredients of her seaweed salad. / I'm rooting for her to make  / But she glances back at me with a look / That tells me she won't.
Coming from the West, / covering the moon, / Clouds – not a sound
I'd love to give you something / but what would help?
i get up and drink a glass of water because my throat is dry like i'm staring down a thousand years of mondays / the water is cool and earnest as it trickles down my throat and lands somewhere behind my ribs
I am the secret whispered bright  / to gods who cannot know – or care  / A song unsung, an unread book  / an unheard, desperate, dying prayer.
Rock rosed – behind the Casbah / the sun has disappearing act
Anyone else here feel like loneliness is the biggest reason for their depression? / Talking to other people isn't pleasurable. I think I'm fucking crazy. / Lonely and wishing I was dead.
That's an unencouraging sign, / the fish store / is closed
Yellow halfmoon cradled / among the horizontal boards / Of my fence
and evergreen flashes filled with / sparks of the light you can catch when it's / filtered through leaves.
A spring mosquito / dont even know / How to bite!
The word HANDICAPPED / sliding over snow / On a newspaper
I went in the woods / to meditate / It was too cold
Write more please, but say less too; there's / more to say, but not from you. Press / that ballpoint 'til it bleeds for- / saken thoughts and worldly needs.
going so maybe I'll take a sleeping pill or forty and / ride the mystery machine on my way out like / jinkies
Crazy Cloud likes his own mind its wish for flutesongs rainy nights / drinking muttering beside his women
Will the surface suffocate me  / as much as this sea? / I don't want to lose the feeling  / of floating in thee;
This July evening, / A large frog / On my doorsill
Grasp a hunk of mouse-brown hair  / in my fist and drag the brush through  / the ends. I have no idea if this is  / how you do it; mom never taught me  / never braided me in pigtails  / or pulled it back in a pony. Never  / bothered.
Gray day / the blue spruce / Is green
Who broke off pieces of your life, one by one  / slowly peeling you back  / layer by layer  / until you were raw and exposed and / said- / "this is how it ought to be."
She slept enveloped / inside my arms / like a letter  / and like any grand secret / I wanted nothing more
little snippets of my mind to read the next morning. / And this is how I end up with texts like / “Snoop Dogg making sushi”
Nirvana, as when the rain / puts out a little fire
Get to go / fork a hoss / And head for Mexico
From handgun of virility / Come soldiers of fertility / Agile paratroopers of sex / Meet stifling kleenex
I spot an exit on the deck  / I wrap it tightly 'round my neck
Now 8 months pass, there's nothing better that I have in life / You keep me on my toes like I'm dancing on a knife / The paper comes and then it says "will you be man and wife?" / So I took it and signed my name.
Rain in North Caroline / the saints / Are still meditating
Desolation, Desolation, / so hard / To come down off of

Dusk boy / smashing dandelions / With a stick
