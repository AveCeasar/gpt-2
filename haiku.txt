2 traveling salesmen
   passing each other
On a Western road

50 miles from N.Y.
   all alone in Nature,
The squirrel eating

A balloon caught
   in the tree – dusk
In Central Park zoo

Abbid abbayd ingrat
   - Lighthouse
On the Azores

A black bull
   and a white bird
Standing together on the shore

A big fat flake
   of snow
Falling all alone

A bird hanging
   on the wire
At dawn

A bird on
   the branch out there
- I waved

A bird pecking kernels
   on a grassy hillside
Just mowed

A bottle of wine, 
   a bishop -
Everything is God

A bubble, a shadow -
   woop -
The lightning flash

A car is coming but
   the cat knows
It's not a snake

A current pimple
   In the mind’s
Old man

After a year and a half
   finally saw the rat
Big and fat

After supper
   on crossed paws,
The cat meditates

After the earthquake,
   A child crying
In the silence

After the shower,
   among the drenched roses,
the bird thrashing in the bath

After the shower
   my cat meowing
on the porch

After the shower
   the red roses
In the green, green

A full November moon
   and mild,
Mary Carney

Ah, Genghiz Khan
   weeping – where
did Autumn go?

Ah Jerusalem – how many
   Autumn saints slaughtered
Thee with Christ?

Ah the birds
   at dawn, 
my mother and father

Ah, the crickets
   are screaming
at the moon

Ah who cares?
   I’ll do what I want -
Roll another joint

All day long wearing 
   a hat that wasn't 
On my head

All I see is what
   I see -
Red fire sunset

All that ocean of blue
   soon as those clouds
Pass away

All the insects ceased
   in honor
Of the moon

All these sages
   Sleep
with their mouths open

All the wash 
   on the line
Advanced one foot

Alone at home reading
   Yoka Daishi,
Drinking tea

Alone, in old
   clothes, sipping wine
Beneath the moon

A long island
   in the sky
The Milky Way

A long way from
   The Beat Generation
In the rain forest

Alpine fir with
   snowcap’t backround –
It doesn’t matter

America: fishing licenses
   the license
To meditate

Am I a flower
   bee, that you
Stare at me?

A million acres
   of Bo-trees
And not one Buddha

Among the nervous birds
   the morning dove
Nibbles quietly

A mother & son
   just took a shortcut
Thru my yard

Ancient ancient world
   - tight skirts
By the new car

And as for Kennedy -
   in Autumn he slept
By swishing peaceful trees

And the quiet cat
   sitting by the post
Perceives the moon

Answered a letter
   and took a hot bath
- Spring rain

Apassionata Sonata
   - hiballs, gray
Afternoon in October

April mist -
   under the pine
At midnight

A pussywillow grew there
   At the foot
Of the breathless tree

A quiet Autumn night
   and these fools
Are starting to argue

A quiet moment -
   low lamp, low logs -
Just cooking the stew

A raindrop from
   the roof
Fell in my beer

Arms folded
   to the moon,
Among the cows

A spring mosquito
   dont even know
How to bite!

As the cool evenings
   make themselves felt,
Smoke from suburban chimneys

Asking Albert Saijo
   for a haiku,
He said nothing

A stump with sawdust
   - a place
To meditate

At a Coney Island
   hamburger
In Vancouver Washington

At night
   The girl I denied
Walking away

A turtle sailing along
   on a log,
Head up

Aurora borealis
   over Mount Hozomeen -
The world is eternal

Aurora Borealis
   over the Hozomeen –
The void is stiller

Autumnal cowflops -
   a man
Makes a living.

Autumnal
Cowflops -
but a man must
make a living.

Autumn eve – my
   mother playing old
Love songs on the piano

Autumn night in New Haven
   - the Whippenpoofers
Singing on the train

Autumn night
   low moon -
Fire in Smithtown

Autumn night
   Salvation Army sign
On a cold brick building

Autumn night stove
- I’ve never been
on a farm before.

Autumn nite 
   - Lucien leans to Jack
on the couch.

Autumn nite -
Lucien’s wife
Playing the guitar

Autumn nite -
my mother cuts her throat

Autumn nite -
my mother remembers
my birth

Autumn nite -
the boys
playing haiku.

August in Salinas -
   Autumn leaves in
Clothing store displays

August moon - oh
   I got a boil
On my thigh

August Moon Universe
   - neither new
Nor old

A whole pussywillow
   over there,
Unblown

A yellow witch chewing
   a cigarette,
Those Autumn leaves

Bach through an open
   dawn window -
the birds are silent

Barefoot by the sea,
   stopping to scratch one ankle
With one toe

Barley soup in Scotland
   in November -
Misery everywhere

Bee, why are you
   staring at me?
I'm not a flower!

Beautiful young girls running
   up the library steps
With shorts on

Beautiful summer night
   gorgeous as the robes
Of Jesus

Big books packaged
   from Japan -
Ritz crackers

Big drinking & piano
   parties – Christmas
Come and gone –

Big wall of clouds
   from the North
Coming in – brrrr!

Bird bath trashing,
   by itself -
Autumn wind

Birds chirp
   fog
Bugs the gate

Birds flew
   Over the shack
Rejoicing

Birds flying north -
   Where are the squirrels?
There goes a plane to Boston

Birds singing
   in the dark
In the rainy dawn

Bird suddenly quiet
   on his branch – his 
Wife glancing at him

Bird was gone
   and distance grew
Immensely white

Black bird - no!
   bluebird - pear
Branch still jumping

Blizzard in the suburbs
   - the mailman
And the poet walking

Blizzard in the suburbs
   - old man driving slowly
To the store 3 blocks

Blizzard’s just started
   all that bread scattered,
And just one bird

Blowing in an afternoon wind,
   on a white fence,
A cobweb

Blueberry dubbery
   the chipmunk’s
In the grass

Bluejay drinking at my
   saucer of milk,
Throwing his head back

Breakfast done
   the tomcat curls up
On the down couch

Bred to rejoice,
   the giggling
sunshine leaves

Brighter than the night,
   my barn roof
Of snow

Brokenback goodshit
Heap bigshot
among the Birchtrees.

Buddha laughing
   on Mt. Lanka!
Like Jimmy Durante!

Buddhas in moonlight
   - Mosquito bite
thru hole in my shirt

Buds in the snow
  - the deadly fight
between two birds

Butterfat soil
   of the valley -
Big black slugs

But the Lost Creek trail
   they dont believe
Is in existence any more

Came down from my
   ivory tower
And found no world

Cat eating fish heads
   - All those eyes
In the starlight
Catfish fighting for his life,
   and winning,
Splashing us all
Cat gone 24 hours
   - A piece of his hair
Waving on the door

Change Su Chi’s art
   studio, a silent
Shade in the window

Chief Crazy Horse
   looks tearfully north
The first snow flurries

Chipmunk went in
   - butterfly
Came out

Chou en Lai, his briefcase
   should be fulla leaves,
For all I know

Christ on the Cross crying
   - his mother missed
Her October porridge

Churchbells ringing in town
   - The caterpillar
In the grass

Close your eyes -
   Landlord knocking
On the back door

Closing the book,
   rubbing my eyes -
The sleepy August dawn

Cloudy autumn nite
- cold water drips
in the sink.

Coffee beans!
   - Methinks I smell
The Canaries!

Cold crisp October morning
   - the cats fighting
In the weeds

Cold gray tufts
   of winter grass
Under the stars

Coming from the West,
   covering the moon,
Clouds – not a sound

Concatenation! – the bicycle
   pulls the wagon
Because the rope is tied

Content, the top trees
   shrouded
In gray fog

Cool breeze - maybe
   just a shillyshallying snow
That'll ruin everything

Cool breezy morning
   - the cat is rolling
On his back

Cool sunny autumn day,
   I’ll mow the lawn
one last time

Cradled and warm,
   the upper snow,
The trackless

Crisp wind
   My tired limbs
Relaxed before the coals

Crossing the football field,
   coming home from work,
The lonely businessman

Dawn, a falling star
   - A dewdrop lands
On my head!

Dawn – crows cawing,
   ducks quack quacking,
Kitchen windows lighting

Dawn – the first
   robins singing
to the new moon

Dawn – the tomcat
   hurrying home
With his tail down

Dawn – the writer who
   hasn’t shaved,
Poring over notebooks

Dawn wind
   in the spruces
- The late moon

Debris on the lake
   - my soul
Is upset

Desk cluttered
   with mail -
My mind is quiet

Desolation, Desolation,
   so hard
To come down off of

Desolation, Desolation,
   wherefore have you
Earned you name?

Disturbing my mind essence,
   all that food
I have to cook

Do you know why my name is Jack?
   Why?
That’s why.

Drinking wine
   - the Queen of Greece
on a postage stamp

Drizzle -
   Midnight pine,
I sit dry

Drunk as a hoot owl
   writing letters
By thunderstorm

Drunken deterioration -
   ho-hum,
Shooting star

Dusk - boy
   smashing dandelions
With a stick

Dusk in the holy
   woods -
Dust on my window

Dusk now –
   what’s left of
An ancient pier

Dusk - the bird
   on the fence
A contemporary of mine

Dusk – The blizzard
   hides everything,
Even the night

Early morning gentle rain,
   two big bumblebees
Humming at their work

Early morning with the
   happy dogs -
I forgot the Path

Early morning yellow flowers
   - Thinking about
The drunkards of Mexico

Elephants munching
   on grass - loving
Head side by side

Eleven quick skulks
   to Fall
And still cool

Emptiness
   of the Ananda glass bead,
Is the bowing weeds

Empty baseball field
   - A robin,
Hops along the bench

Evening coming -
   The office girl
unloosing her scarf

Everlastingly loose
   and responsive,
The cloud business

Every cat in Kyoto
   can see through the fog

Everyone of my knocks
   disturbs my daughter
Sleeping in her December grave

Everywhere beyond
   the Truth,
Empty space blue

February dawn – frost
   on the path
Where I paced all winter

February gales - racing
   westward through
The clouds, the moon

Fiddlydee! -
   Another day,
Another something-or-other!

Fighting over a peach
   stone, bluejays
In the bushes

First December cold
   wave - not even
One cricket

First frost dropped
   all leaves
Last night – leafsmoke

Flowers
   aim crookedly
At the straight death

For a moment
   the moon
Wore goggles

Following each other,
   my cats stop
When it thunders

Forever and forever
   everything’s alright -
midnight woods

Four bluejays quiet
   in the afternoon tree,
Occasionally scratching

Four in morning -
   creak my mother
In her bed

Free as a pine
   goofing
For the wind

Frogs don’t care
   just sit there
Brooding on the moon

Front hooves spread,
   the mule scratches his
Neck along a log

Frozen
   in the birdbath,
A leaf

Full moon in the trees
   - across the street,
the jail

Full moon of October
   - The tiny mew
of the Kitty

Full moon -
   Pine tree -
Old house

Full moon, white snow, -
   my bottle
Of purple jello

Gary  gone from the shack
   like smoke
- My lonely shoes

Gary Snyder
   is a haiku
far away

Gee last night -
   dreamed
Of Harry Truman

Geronimo, in Autumn
   says no to peaceful
Cochise - Smoke rises

Get to go -
   fork a hoss
And head for Mexico

Ghengis Khan looks fiercely
   east, with red eyes,
Hungering for Autumn vengeance

Girls' footprints
   in the sand
- Old mossy pile

Girl trapped beneath the
   steering wheel, beautiful
As the Dalai Lama’s dream

Girl with wagon -
   what do
I know?

Giving an apple
   to the mule, the big lips
Taking hold

Glow worms
   brightly sleeping
On my flowers

Glow worm sleeping 
   on this flower,
Your light's on!

God’s dream,
   It’s only
A dream

Grain Elevators are tall trucks
   that let the road
approach them

Grain Elevators on
   Saturday waiting for
The farmers to come home

Grain elevators, waiting
   for the road
To approach them

Grass waves,
   hens chuckle,
Nothing’s happening

Gray day -
   the blue spruce 
Is green

Gray orb of the moon
   behind silver clouds -
The Spanish moss

Gray spring rain
   - I never clipped
My hedges  

Greyhound bus,
   flowing all night,
Virginia

Gull sailing
   in the saffron sky -
The Holy Ghost wanted it

Haiku! Haiku!
   Still wears a bandage
Over his injured eye!

Haiku my eyes!
   my mother is calling!

Haiku, shmaiku, I cant
   understand the intention
of reality

Halloween colors
   orange and black
On a summer butterfly

Hand in hand in a red valley
   with the universal schoolteacher -
the first morning

Haunted Autumn visiting
   familiar August,
Those last 2 days

Haydn’s creation or
   Coleman Hawkins, I can
Fix em just right

Here comes
   My dragon -
goodbye!

Here comes the nightly
   moth, to his nightly
Death, at my lamp

Her yellow dolls bowing
   on the shelf -
My dead step grandmother

Highest perfect fool -
   the wisdom
Of the two-legged rat

High in the Sky
   the Fathers Send Messages
From on High

High noon
   in Northport
- Alien shore

Hitch hiked a thousand
   miles and brought
You wine

Hmf – Ole Starvation Ridge
   is
Milkied o’er

Holding up my purring 
   cat to the moon,
I sighed

Holy sleep
   - Hanshan
Was right

Horse waving his tail
   in a field of clover
At sundown

Hot coffee
   and a cigarette –
why zazen?

Hot tea, in the cold
   moonlit snow -
a burp

How cold! – late
   September baseball -
The crickets

How’d those guys
   get in here,
those two flies?

How many cats they need
   around here
For any orgy?

How flowers love
   the sun,
Blinking there!

How that butterfly’ll wake up
   When someone
Bongs that bell!

Huge knot in the
   Redwood tree
Looking like Zeus’ face

Hummingbird hums
   hello – bugs
Race and swoop

Hurrying things along,
   Autumn rain
On my awning

I called – Dipankara
   instructed me
By saying nothing

I called Hanshan
   in the fog -
Silence, it said

I called Hanshan
   in the mountains
- there was no answer

I close my eyes -
   I hear & see
Mandala

I don’t care -
   the low yellow
Moon loves me

I don’t care
   what
thusness is

I drink my tea
   and say
Hm hm

If I go out now,
   my paws
will get wet

I found my
   cat - one
Silent star

Ignoring my bread,
   the bird peeking
In the grass

I gotta make it in terms /that anyone can understand/
Did I tell ya about my nightmare?

I hate the ecstasy
   Of that rose,
That hairy rose

I'll climb up a tree
   and scratch Katapatafataya

I made raspberry fruit jello
   The color of rubies
In the setting sun

I’m back here in the middle
   of nowhere -
At least I think so

I’m so mad
   I could bite
The montaintops

In a Mojave dust storm
   Albert said: "Senzeie,
Was a Mongolian waif"

In Autumn Geronimo
   weeps - no pony
With a blanket

In back of the Supermarket,
   in the parking lot weeds,
Purple flowers

In enormous blizzard
   burying everything
My cat’s out mating

In enormous blizzard
   burying everything -
My cat turned back

In Hakkaido a cat
   has no luck

In London-town cats
   can sleep
In the butcher's doorway.

In my medicine cabinet
   the winter fly
Has died of old age

In the chair
   I decided to call Haiku
By the name of Pop

In the desert sun
   in Arizona,
A yellow railroad caboose

In the late afternoon
   peaks, I see
The hope

In the lovely sun
   reading lovely
Haikus - Spring

In the middle of
   the corn, a new
Car slithering

In the morning frost
   the cats
Stepped slowly

In the quiet house,
   my mother's
Moaning yawns

In the sun     
   the butterfly wings
Like a church window

Iowa clouds
   following each other
Into Eternity

I rubbed my bearded
   cheek and looked in
The mirror – Ki!

I said a joke
   under the stars
- No laughter

I should have scratched
   that spot before
I started to sleep

I’ve turned up
   the lamp again
- The sleeping moth

I went in the woods
   to meditate -
It was too cold

I woke up
   - two flies were boffing
On my forehead

Jack reads his book
aloud at nite
- the stars come out.

Juju [=juzu] beads on the
   Zen manual -
My knees are cold

June – the snow
   of blossoms
On the ground

Just woke up
   - afternoon pines
Playing the wind

Kicked the cupboard
   and hurt my toe
- Rage

Kneedeep in the
   blizzard, the ancient
Misery of the cat

Kneedeep, teeth
   to the blizzard,
My cat gazing at me

Late afternoon –
   it’s not the void
That changed

Late afternoon -
   my bare back’s
Cold

Late afternoon -
   the lake sparkle
Blinds me

Late afternoon -
   the mop is drying
On the rock

Late April
   dusk bluster -
Lions & lambs

Late autumn nite
the last faint cricket.

Late moon rising
   - Frost
On the grass

Lay the pencil
   away – no more
thoughts, no lead

Leaf dropping straight
   In the windless midnight:
The dream of change

Leaves falling everywhere
   in the November
Midnight moonshine

Leaves skittering on
   the tin roof
- August fog in Big Sur

Lilacs at dusk
   - one petal
fell

Listen to the birds sing!
   All the little birds
Will die!

Listening to birds using
   different voices, losing
My perspective of History

Little frogs screaming
   in the ditch
At nightfall

Little pieces of ice
   in the moonlight
Snow, thousands of em

Lonely brickwalls in Detroit
   Sunday afternoon
piss call

Lonesome blubbers
   grinding out the decades
with wet lips

Looking around to think
   I saw the thick white cloud
Above the house

Looking for my cat
   in the weeds,
I found a butterfly

Looking up at the stars,
   feeling sad,
Going "tsk tsk tsk" 

Looking up to see
   the airplane
I only saw the TV aerial

Lost cat Timmy -
   he wont be back
In a blue moon

Loves his own belly
   The way I love my life,
The white cat

Made hot cocoa
   at night,
Sang by woodfire

Man dying - 
   Harbor lights
On still water

Man – nothing but
   a
Rain barrel

Mao Tse Tung has taken
   too many Siberian sacred
Mushrooms in Autumn

May grass -
   Nothing much
To do

Mayonnaise -
   mayonnaise comes in cans
Down the river

Memère says: "Planets are
   far apart so people
Can't bother each other."

Me, my pipe,
   my folded legs -
Far from Buddha

Men and women
   Yakking beneath
the eternal Void

Mexico – After the dim
   markets, bright
San Juan Letran

Me, you – you, me
   Everybody -
He-he

Middle of my Mandala
   - Full moon
In the water

Mild spring night -
   a teenage girl said
"Good evening" in the dark

Missing a kick
   at the icebox door
It closed anyway

Mist before the peak
   - the dream
Goes on

Mist boiling from the
   ridge - the mountains
Are clean

Mist falling
   - Purple flowers
Growing

Mists blew by, I
   Closed my eyes, -
Stove did the talking

Misurgirafical & plomlied
   - ding dang
The Buddha’s gang

Moon behind
   Black clouds -
Silver seas

Moon in the
   bird bath -
One star too

Morning meadow -
   Catching my eye,
On weed

Morning sun -
   The purple petals,
Four have fallen

Moth sleeping
   on the newly plastered wall
- the spring rain

M’ugly spine – the loss
   of the kingdom
Of Heaven

Mule on the seashore
   One thousand foot
Bridge above

My blue spruce
   in the pale
Haze dusk

My butterfly came
   to sit in my flower,
Sir Me

My cat eating
   at his saucer
- Spring moon

My cat’s asleep
   - poor little angel,
the burden of flesh!

My Christ blinds
   are down -
I’m reading about Virgin

My corncub pipe
   hot from
the sun

My critics jiggle
   constantly like
Poison ivy in the rain

My flashlight,
   where I put it this afternoon
Twisted away in sleep

My friend standing
   in my bedroom -
The spring rain

My hand,
   A thing with hairs,
rising and falling with my belly

My hands on my lap
   June night,
Full moon

My Japanese blinds
   are down -
I’m reading about Ethiopia

My rumpled couch
   - The lady's voice
Next door

My rose arbor knows more
   about June
Than it'll know about winter

My pipe unlit
   beside the Diamond
Sutra - What to think?

Napoleon in bronze
   the burning Blakean
mountains

Nat Wills, a tramp
   - America
In 1905

Neons, Chinese restaurants
   coming on -
Girls come by shades

New aluminum
   grammar school
In old lamplight

New neighbors 
   - light
In the old house

Nibbling his ankle,
   the mule’s teeth
Like kettle drum

Nightfall,
   boy smashing dandelions
with a stick

Nightfall - too dark 
   to read the page,
Too cold

Night fall - too dark 
   to read the page,
Too dark

Night rain – neighbors
   Arguing loud voices
In next house

Night – six petals
   have fallen from
Bodhidharma’s bouquet

Nirvana, as when the rain
   puts out a little fire

No imaginary judgments
   of form,
The clouds

No telegram today
   - Only more 
Leaves fell

Nodding against the wall, 
   the flowers
Sneeze

Nose hairs in the moon
   - My ass
Is cold

November - how nasal
   the drunken
Conductor's call

November’s New Haven
   baggagemaster stiffly
Disregards my glance

November the seventh
   The last 
Faint cricket

Nored the Atlantican Astrologer
   weeps because the King
Laid his Autumn girl!

October night, lights
   of Connecticut towns
Across the sound

O for 
   Vermont again -
The barn on an Autumn night

Oh another weekend’s
   started – people squeaking
On U-turning tires

Oh I could drink up
   The whole Yellow River
In my love for Li Po!

Oh moon,
   such dismay?
- Earths betray

Old man dying in a room -
   Groan
At five o’clock

Old man of Aix
   white hair, beret -
Gone up the Cezanne street

On Desolation
   I was the alonest man
in the world

One drop from
   the blue spruce -
two more drops

One flower
   on the cliffside
Nodding at the canyon

One foot on the bar
   of soap,
The Bluejay peeking

On Starvation Ridge
   little sticks
Are trying to grow

On the sidewalk
   A dead baby bird
For the ants

OO a continent
   in a birdbath -
April full moon

Ooh! they kicked up
   a cloud of dust!
The birds in my yard

Or, walking the same or different
   paths
The moon follows each

O Sebastian, where art thou?
   Pa, watch over us!
Saints, thank you!

Peeking at the moon
   in January, Bodhisattva
Takes a secret piss

Perfect circle round
   the moon
In the center of the sky

Perfectly silent
   in the starry night,
the little tree

Perfect moonlit night
   marred
By family squabbles

Phantom Rose
   Lust
Is a Leopard

Pink petals on
   gnarly Japanese twigs
In rain

Playing basketball
   - the lady next door
Watching again

Poor gentle flesh -
   there is
No answer

Poor tortured teeth
   under
The blue sky

Protected by the clouds,
   the moon
Sleeps sailing

Prayerbeads
   on the Holy Book
- My knees are cold

Praying all the time -
   talking
To myself

Propped up on my shoe
   the Diamond Sutra -
Propped up on a pine root

Puddles at dusk
   - one drop
fell

Quietly pouring coffee
   in the afternoon,
How pleasant!

Quiet moonlit night -
   Neighbor boy studying
By telescope; - "Ooo!"

Racing westward through
   the clouds in the howling
wind, the moon

Rain in North Caroline
   - the saints
Are still meditating

Rain-in-the-Face
   looks from the hill:
Custer down there

Rain’s over, hammer on wood
   - this cobweb
Rides the sun shine

Rainy night,                     
   the top leaves wave          
In the grey sky

Rainy night
   - I put on
My pajamas

Reading my notes -
   The fly stepping from
The page to the finger

Reading the sutra
   I decided
To go straight

Red roses, white
   clouds, blue sky,
In my birdbath

Red trees -
the dog tears at
an old itch.

Reflected upsidedown
   in the sunset lake, pines,
Pointing to infinity

Resting watchfully, the cat
   and the squirrel
Share the afternoon

Rig rig rig -
   that’s the rat
On the roof

River wonderland –
   The emptiness
Of the golden eternity

Rock rosed – behind the Casbah
   - the sun has disappearing act

Roses! Roses!
   robin wants his
Evening bath!

Run after that
   body – run after
A raging fire

Run over my lawnmower,
   waiting for me to leave,
The frog

Samsara in the morning
   - puppy yipping,
Hot motor steaming

Satisfied, the pine
   bough washing
In the waters

Second thundershower
   over – the sun
Is still high

September raindrops
   from my roof -
Soon icicles

Seven birds in a tree,
   looking
In every direction

Sex – shaking to bread
   as
Providence permits

Shall I break God's commandment?
   Little fly
Rubbing its back legs

Shall I heed God’s commandment?
   - wave breaking
On the rocks -

Shall I say no?
   - fly rubbing
its back legs

She loves Lysander
   not Demetrius -
Who? - Hermia

Ship paint
   on
An old T-shirt

Shooting star! – no,
   lightning bug! -
ah, well, June night

Sitting Bull adjust
   his girdle: the smell
Of smoking fish

Silent pipe -
   peace and quiet
In my heart

Sitting in the sun,
   no bugs yet -
Yellow clover

Sixty sunsets have I seen
   revolve on this perpendicular hill

Skhandas my ass!
   - it’s not
Even that

Sleeping on my desk
   head on the sutras,
my cat

Smell of burning leaves,
   The quiet pool at evening 
In August

Snap your finger
   stop the world!
- Rain falls harder

Snow in my shoe
   Abandoned
Sparrow’s nest

Snow melting,
   streams rushing -
Lookout leave the valley

Snow on the grape
   arbor – the little
dead raisins

So humid you cant
   light matches, like
Living in a tank

Somebody rang my bell
   I said who?
O it doesn’t worldly care

Sometimes they sleep
   with their lights on,
the June bugs

Some trees still
   have naked winter look
- Spring day

Spring day -
   in my mind
Nothing

Spring dusk
   on Fifth Avenue,
A bird

Spring evening -
hobo with hard on
Like bamboo

Spring evening -
   the two
Eighteen year old sisters

Spring is coming
   Yep, all that equipment
for sighs

Spring moon
   on 2nd Avenue
- girl in white coat

Spring night -
   a leaf falling
From my chimney

Spring night – the gleam
   of the fish head eye
In the grass

Spring night
   the silence
Of the stars

Spring night – the sound
   of the cat
Chewing fish heads

Spring night -
   the neighbor hammering
In the new old house

Spring rain,
   Kicking stones
An arrowhead

Standing on the end
   on top of the tree,
The Big Dipper

Stare intently
   at my candle
- Pool of wax

Staring at each other,
   Squirrel in the branch,
Cat in the grass

Stop slipping me
   Your old Diamond Sutra
You illimitable tight-ass!

Straining at the padlock,
   the garage doors
At noon

Suddenly the official
   goes cross eyed
And floats away

Summer afternoon -
   impatiently chewing
The jasmine leaf

Summer night - 
   I put out
The empty milk bottle

Summer night - 
   the kitten playing
With the Zen calendar

Sunday in a bar
   in Woodland Calif.
- One noon beer

Sunday -
   the sky is blue,
The flowers are red

Sunny day – bird tracks
   & cat tracks
In the snow

Sun on the rocks -
   a fighting snag
Holds on

Sun shining on
   A distant mountain
- the low moon

Surprising cat fight
   in the parlor on a
Blustery September night

Sweet birds, chordless
   except in another 
Clime

Swinging on delicate hinges
   the Autumn Leaf
Almost off the stem

Taghagata [=Tathagata] neither loathes
   nor loves
His body’s milk or shit

Take up a cup of water
   from the ocean
And there I am

Temple trees
   across the creek
- Fog blowing

Terraces of fern
   in the dripping
Redwood shade

Thanks to Coolidge,
   Hoover – Hoover – but Autumn,
Roosevelt done America in

That's an unencouraging sign,
   the fish store
is closed

The Angel’s hair
   trailed on my chin
Like a cobweb

The ant struggles escaping
   from the web -
The spider’s non-comment

The backyard I tried to draw
   - It still looks
The same

The barking dog -
   Kill him
With a bicycle wheel

The barn, swimming
   in a sea
Of windblown leaves

The beautiful red
   dogwood tree
Waiting for the cross

The bird came on the branch
   - danced three times -
And burred away

The birds start singing
but he is in the cat meadows

The bird’s still on top
   of that tree,
High above the fog

The birds
   surprise me
On all sides

The book
   stands all by itself
on the shelf

The bottoms of my shoes
   are clean
From walking in the rain

The carpenter of spring
   the Zen
of hammer and nail

The castle of the Gandharvas
   is full of aging
Young couples

The cat: a little
   body being used
By a little person

The cat musing
   along the ground -
cold gray day

The clouds are
   following each other
Into Eternity

The clouds assume
   as I assume,
Faces of hermits

The cows of Autumn -
   laughing along the fence,
Roosters at Dawn

The cow, taking a big
   dreamy crap, turning
To look at me

The creamer gives,
   the groaner quakes -
the angel smiles

The cricket in my cellar window, this quiet
   Sunday afternoon

The crickets - crying
   for rain - 
Again?

The days go -
   They cant stay -
I don’t realize

The dog yawned
   and almost swallowed
My Dharma

The dregs of my coffee
   Glisten
In the morning light

The droopy constellation
   on the grassy hill -
Emily Dickinson’s Tomb

The earth keeps turning
   like a dreary
Immortal

The earth winked
   at me - right
In the john

The falling snow -
   The hissing radiators -
The bride out there

The flies on the porch
   and the fog on the peaks
Are so sad

The flowers don’t seem
   to mind
the stupid May sunshine

The fly, just as
   lonesome as I am
In this empty house

The full moon -
   the cat gone -
My sleeping mother

The gently moving
   leaves
Of the August afternoon

The Golden Gate
   creaks
With sunset rust

The hermit’s broom,
   the fire, the kettle
- August night

The housecats, amazed
   at something new,
Looking in the same direction

The jazz trombone,
   The moving curtain,
- Spring rain

The leaves, fighting
   the empty sky -
No clouds helping
THE LIGHT BULB
   SUDDENLY WENT OUT -
STOPPED READING
The little sparrow
   on my eave drainpipe
Is looking around

The little sparrow on the eave drainpipe
My heart flutters

The little white cat
   Walks in the grass
With his tail up in the air

The little worm
   lowers itself from the roof
By a self shat thread

The low yellow
   moon above 
The quiet lamplit house

The mansion of
   the moon
Has hidden faces

The microscopic red bugs
   in the sea-side sand
Do they meet and greet?

The mind of the flower
   regards my mind
Externally

The mist in front
   of the morning mountains
- late Autumn

The moon had
   a cat's mustache,
For a second

The moon
   is a
Blind lemon

The moon is moving,
   thru the clouds
Like a slow balloon

The moon is white -
   the lamps are
Yellow

The moon,
   the falling star
- Look elsewhere

The mountains
   are mighty patient,
Buddha-man

The mule, turning
   slowly, rubbing his
Behind on a log

The national scene
   - late afternoon sun
In those trees

The new moon
   is the toe nail
Of God

The night
   is red
with stars

”The old pond, yes!
   - the water jumped into
By a frog”

The other man, just as
   lonesome as I am
In this empty universe

The pine woods
   move
In the mist

The poppies! - 
   I could die
In delicacy now

The postman is late
   - The toilet window
Is shining

The purple wee flower
   should be reflected
In that low water

The racket of the starlings
   in the trees -
My cat’s back

The raindrops have plenty
   of personality -
Each one

The rain has filled
   the birdbath
Again, almost

The red paper
   waves for the breeze
- the breeze

The red roof of the barn
   is ravelled
Like familiar meat

There is no deep
   turning-about
In the Void

There’s no Buddha
   because
There’s no me

There’s nothing there
   because
I dont care

The robin on
   the television antenna,
Something on his beak

The rose moves
   like a Reichian disciple
On its stem

These little gray sparrows on the roof
I’ll shot my editor

The sky is still empty,
   the rose is still
On the typewriter keys

The sleeping moth -
   he doesn’t know
The lamps turned up again

The smiling fish -
   where are they,
Scouting bird?

The smoke of old
   naval battles
Is gone

The son packs
   quietly as the
Mother sleeps

The son who wants solitude,
   Enveloped
In his room

The sound of silence
   is all the instruction
You’ll get

The Spring moon -
   How many miles away
Those orange blossoms!

The stars are racing
   real fast
Through the clouds

The storm,
   like Dostoevsky
Builds up as it lists

The strumming of the trees
   reminded me
Of immortal afternoon

The summer chair
   rocking by itself
In the blizzard

The sun keeps getting
   dimmer - foghorns
began to blow in the bay

The Sunny Breeze
   will come to me
Presently

The taste
   of rain -
Why kneel?

The top of Jack
   Mountain – done in
By golden clouds

The train speeding
   thru emptiness
- I was a trainman

The tree looks
   like a dog
Barking at Heaven

The tree moving
   in the moonlight
Wise to me

The trees, already
   bent in the windless
Oklahoma plain

The trees are putting on
   Noh plays - 
Booming, roaring

The vigorous bell-ringing priest
   the catch in the harbor

The white cat
   Is green in the tree shade,
Like Gauguin’s horse

The white chair is
   holding its arms out
to Heaven - dandelions

The whiteness of the houses
   in the moon
Snow everywhere

The windmills of
   Oklahoma look
In every direction

"The wind agrees with me
   not the sun" -
Washlines

The wind sent
   a leaf on
the robin’s back

The word HANDICAPPED
   sliding over snow
On a newspaper

The yellow dolls bow -
   Poor lady
Is dead

This July evening,
   A large frog
On my doorsill

This October evening,
   the velvet eyes
Of Manju[sh]ri

Those birds sitting
   out there on the fence -
They're all going to die.

Three little sparrows
   on the roof
Talking quietly, sadly

Three pencils arranged,
   Three minutes,
Sambaghakaya, Nirvanakaya, Dharmakaya

Thunder and snow -
   how
We shall go!

Thunder in the mountains -
   the iron
Of my mother's love

Thunderstorm over
   - there! The light
is on again

Time keeps running out
   - sweat
On my brow, from playing

To the South,
   in the moonlight,
A sash of cloud

Tonight I'll lower
   my tail -
I've seen them around town

that star
   is waving & flaming
Something awful

Too hot to write 
   haiku – crickets
and mosquitoes

Train on the horizon -
   my window
rattles

Train tunnel, too dark
   for me to write: that
"Men are ignorant"

Trees cant reach
   for a glass
Of water

Trying to study sutras,
   the kitten on my page
Demanding affection

Tuesday - one more
   drop of rain
From my roof

Twilight - the bird
   in the bush
In the rain

Two ants hurry
   to catch up
With lonely Joe

Two cars passing
   on the freeway
- Husband and wife

Two clouds kissing
   backed up to look
At each other

Two Japanese boys
   singing
Inky Dinky Parly Voo

Useless! useless!
   - heavy rain driving 
Into the sea

Velvet horses
   in the valley auction -
Woman sings

Voices of critics
   in the theater lobby -
A moth on the carpet

Walking along the night beach,
   - Military music 
On the boulevard. 

Walking down road with Allen -
   Walking down the road in Autumn.

Walking down the road
   with Allen
- An old dream
   the same dream.

Walking down the road/a crushed snake.
autumn
Red trees -

Walking down the road with dog
   - a crushed leaf

Walking down the road
with dog -
a crushed snake.

Walking down the road with Jack -
a crushed snake

Walking with the dog on the road
   - a crooked leaf.

Walking on the water wasn’t 
   Built in a day

Walking over the water
   my shadow,
Heavier than lead

WARM WIND
   makes the pines
Talk Deep

Wednesday blah
   blah blah -
My mind hurts

Who cares about the pop-off trees
   of Provence?
A road’s a road

Why’d I open my eyes?
   because
I wanted to

Winking over his pipe
   the Buddha lumberman
Nowhere

Work of the quiet
   mountain, this
Torrent of purity

Worm is looking
   at the moon,
Waiting for me

Wash hung out
   by moonlight
- Friday night

Washing my face
   with snow
Beneath the Little Dipper

Waiting for the leaves
   to fall; -
There goes one!

Waiting for the Zipper
   4 PM -
Sun in West clouds, gold

Water in the birdbath
   - a film of ice
On the moon

Waiting with me for
   the end of this ephemeral
Existence – the moon

Water in a hole
   - behold
The soddden skies

Waving goodbye,
   the little girl,
Backing up

Well here I am,
   2 PM - 
What day is it?

Wet fog
   shining
In lamplit leaves

Whatever it is, I quit
   - now I'll let my
breath out –

What could be newer? this
   new little bird
Not yet summer fat!

When the moon sinks
   down to the power line,
I'll go in

What is a rainbow,
   Lord? – a hoop
For the lowly

What is Buddhism?
   - A crazy little
Bird blub

What passes through
   is amusing
Himself being dew

While meditating
   I am Buddha -
Who else?

White clouds of this steamy planet
   obstruct
My vision of the blue void

White rose with red
   splashes – Oh
Vanilla ice cream cherry!

Who wd have guessed
   that a January moon
could be so orange!

Why explain?
   bear burdens
In silence

Wild to sit on a haypile,
   Writing Haikus,
Drinkin wine

Wind too strong
   - empty nest
At midnight

Windows rattling
   in the wind
I’m a lousy lover

Wine at dawn
   - The long
Rainy sleep

Winter – that
   sparrow’s nest
Still empty

Wish I were a rooster
   and leave my sperm
On the sidewalk, shining!

"Woo!" – bird of perfect
   balance on the fir
Just moved his tail

Wooden house
   raw gray -
Pink light in the window

Woke up groaning
   with a dream of a priest
Eating chicken necks

Yard tonight an eerie
   moon leafshroud
A midsummernight’s dream

Yellow halfmoon cradled
   among the horizontal boards
Of my fence

"You and me"
   I sang
Looking at the cemetery

You’d be surprised
   how little I knew
Even up to yesterday

You paid yr homage
   to the moon,
And she sank

Your belly’s too big
   for your
Little teeth

Who says my poems are poems?
My poems are not poems.
After you know my poems are not poems,
Then we can begin to discuss poetry!

It is not that I do not wish to associate with men,
But living alone I have the better Way.

What will remain as my legacy?
Flowers in the spring,
The cuckoo in summer,
And the crimson leaves of autumn.

Life is like a dewdrop,
Empty and fleeting;
My years are gone
And now, quivering and frail,
I must fade away.

With no-mind, blossoms invite the butterfly;
With no-mind, the butterfly visits the blossoms.
When the flower blooms, the butterfly comes;
When the butterfly comes, the flower blooms.
I do not “know” others,
Others do not “know” me.
Not-knowing each other we naturally follow the Way.

Long ago, I often drank sakè at this house;
now only the earth
Covered with plum blossoms.

ONE NARROW path surrounded by a dense forest;
On all sides, mountains lie in darkness.
The autumn leaves have already fallen.
No rain, but still the rocks are dark with moss.
Returning to my hermitage along a way known to few,
Carrying a basket of fresh mushrooms
And a jar of pure water from the temple well.

THE RAIN has stopped, the clouds have drifted away, and the weather is clear again.
If your heart is pure, then all things in your world are pure.
Abandon this fleeting world, abandon yourself,
Then the moon and flowers will guide you along the Way.

I SIT quietly, listening to the falling leaves—
A lonely hut, a life of renunciation.
The past has faded, things are no longer remembered.
My sleeve is wet with tears.

STONE steps, a mound of lustrous green moss;
The wind carries the scent of cedar and pine.
The rain has stopped and it is beginning to clear.
I call to the children as I walk to get some village sakè.
After drinking too much, I happily write these verses.

After a night of rain, water covers the village path.
This morning the thick grass by my hut is cool.
In the window, distant mountains the color of blue-green jade.
Outside, a river flows like shimmering silk.
Under a cliff near my hut, I wash out my sore ear with pure spring water.
In the trees, cicadas recite their fall verse.
I had prepared my robe and staff for a walk,
But the quiet beauty keeps me here.

FRESH morning snow in front of the shrine.
The trees! Are they white with peach blossoms
Or white with snow?
The children and I joyfully throw snowballs.

SPRING—slowly the peaceful sound
Of a priest’s staff drifts from the village.
In the garden, green willows;
Water plants float serenely in the pond.
My bowl is fragrant from the rice of a thousand homes;
My heart has renounced the sovereignty of riches and worldly fame.
Quietly cherishing the memory of the ancient Buddhas,
I walk to the village for another day of begging.

WALKING beside a clear running river, I come to a farmhouse.
The evening chill has given way to the warmth of the morning sun.
Sparrows gather in a bamboo grove, voices fluttering here and there.
I meet the old farmer returning to his home;
He greets me like a long-lost friend.
At his cottage, the farmer’s wife heats sakè
While we eat freshly picked vegetables and chat.
Together, gloriously drunk, we no longer know
The meaning of unhappiness.

YESTERDAY I went to town begging food from east to west.
My shoulders are getting thinner and I cannot recall the last time I had a heavy rice sack.
The thick frost is a continual reminder of my thin robe.
My old friends, where have they gone?
Even new faces are few.
As I walk toward the deserted summer pavilion,
Nothing but the wind of late autumn blowing through the pines and oaks.

AUTUMN night—unable to sleep, I leave my tiny cottage.
Fall insects cry under the rocks, and
The cold branches are sparsely covered.
Far away, from deep in the valley, the sound of water.
The moon rises slowly over the highest peak;
I stand there quietly for a long time and
My robe becomes moist with dew.

RETURNING to my hermitage after filling my rice bowl,
Now only the gentle glow of twilight.
Surrounded by mountain peaks and thinly scattered leaves;
In the forest a winter crow flies.

MY LIFE may appear melancholy,
But traveling through this world
I have entrusted myself to Heaven.
In my sack, three shō of rice;
By the hearth, a bundle of firewood.
If someone asks what is the mark of enlightenment or illusion,
I cannot say—wealth and honor are nothing but dust.
As the evening rain falls I sit in my hermitage
And stretch out both feet in answer.
 
One shō is about two quarts.

SHAGGY hair past the ears,
A worn-out robe resembling white clouds and dark smoke.
Half drunk, half sober, I return home,
Children all around, guiding me along the Way.
 
 
The wind blows through my tiny hermitage,
Not one thing is in the room.
Outside, a thousand cedars;
On the wall, several poems are written.
Now the kettle is covered with dust,
And no smoke rises from the rice steamer.
Who is pounding at my moonlit gate?
Only an old man from East Village.

AN OLD and useless body,
I have seen many generations of flowers in this lonely, borrowed hermitage.
When spring comes, and if I am still alive,
Surely I will come to see you again—
Listen for the sound of my staff.

A LONELY winter’s day, clear then cloudy.
I want to go out but do not, spending some time in indecision.
Unexpectedly, an old friend comes and urges me to drink with him.
Joyful now, I take out the brush and ink and much paper.

IF THERE is beauty, there must be ugliness;
If there is right, there must be wrong.
Wisdom and ignorance are complementary,
And illusion and enlightenment cannot be separated.
This is an old truth, don’t think it was discovered recently.
“I want this, I want that”
Is nothing but foolishness.
I’ll tell you a secret—
“All things are impermanent!”
 
 

The long winter night! The long winter night seems endless;
When will it be day?
No flame in the lamp nor charcoal in the fireplace;
Lying in bed, listening to the sound of freezing rain.
 
To an old man, dreams come easy;
I let my thoughts drift.
The room is empty and both the sakè and the oil are used up—
The long winter night.
 
When I was a boy studying in an empty hall,
Over and over I had to fill the lamp with oil.
Even now, that task is disagreeable—
The long winter night.

GREEN mountains front and back,
White clouds east and west.
Even if I met a fellow traveler,
No news could I give him.

DEEP IN the mountains at night, alone in my hermitage,
I listen to the plaintive sound of rain and snow.
A monkey cries on top of a mountain;
The sound of the valley river has faded away.
A light flickers in front of the window;
On the desk, the water in the inkstone has dried.
Unable to sleep all night,
I prepare ink and brush, and write this poem.

WINTER—in the eleventh month
Snow falls thick and fast.
A thousand mountains, one color.
Men of the world passing this way are few.
Dense grass conceals the door.
All night in silence, a few woodchips burn slowly
As I read the poems of the ancients.

LONELINESS: spring has already passed.
Silence: I close the gate.
From heaven, darkness; the wisteria arbor is no longer visible.
The stairway is overgrown with herbs
And the rice bag hangs from the fence.
Deep stillness, long isolated from the world.
All night the cuckoo cries.
 

ANOTHER year lingers to an end;
Heaven sends a bitter frost.
Fallen leaves cover the mountains
And there are no travelers to cast shadows on the path.
Endless night: dried leaves burn slowly in the hearth.
Occasionally, the sound of freezing rain.
Dizzy, I try to recall the past—
Nothing here but dreams.

LIGHT sleep, the bane of old age:
Dozing off, evening dreams, waking again.
The fire in the hearth flickers; all night a steady rain
Pours off the banana tree.
Now is the time I wish to share my feelings—
But there is no one.

WE THROW a little woolen ball back and forth.
I don’t want to boast of my skill, but . . .
If someone asks me the secret of my art, I tell him,
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

ALONE, wandering through the mountains,
I come across an abandoned hermitage.
The walls have crumbled, and there is only a path for foxes and rabbits.
The well, next to an ancient bamboo grove, is dry.
Spider webs cover a forgotten book of poems that lies beneath a window.
Dust is piled on the floor,
The stairway is completely hidden by the wild fall grasses.
Crickets, disturbed by my unexpected visit, shriek.
Looking up, I see the setting sun—unbearable loneliness.

THE VICISSITUDES of this world are like the movements of the clouds.
Fifty years of life are nothing but one long dream.
Sparse rain: in my desolate hermitage at night,
Quietly I clutch my robe and lean against the empty window.

DAY AFTER day after day,
The children play peacefully with this old monk.
Always two or three balls kept in my sleeves.
I have had too much to drink—spring tranquillity!

ZEN MASTER Ryōkan!
Like a fool, like a dunce,
Body and mind completely dropped off!

Spring has passed; the mountains and valleys are
Completely hidden in rain and mist.
In the evening the voice of the hototogisu faded,
But now, late at night, again its cry drifts from the bamboo grove.

THE NIGHT is fresh and cool—
Staff in hand, I walk through the gate.
Wisteria and ivy grow together along the winding mountain path;
Birds sing quietly in their nests and a monkey howls nearby.
As I reach a high peak a village appears in the distance.
The old pines are full of poems;
I bend down for a drink of pure spring water.
There is a gentle breeze, and the round moon hangs overhead.
Standing by a deserted building,
I pretend to be a crane softly floating among the clouds.

Today’s begging is finished; at the crossroads
I wander by the side of Hachiman Shrine
Talking with some children.
Last year, a foolish monk;
This year, no change!
 

For more than seventy years, I have been making
Myself dizzy observing men.
I have abandoned trying to penetrate men’s good and bad actions.
Coming and going is a sign of weakness.
Heavy snow in the dead of night—
Under the weather-beaten window, one incense stick.

LIGHT rain—the mountain forest is wrapped in mist.
Slowly the fog changes to clouds and haze.
Along the boundless river bank, many crows.
I walk to a hill overlooking the valley to sit in zazen.

AFTER spending the day begging in town,
I now sit peacefully under a cliff in the evening cool.
Alone, with one robe and one bowl—
The life of a Zen monk is truly the best!
 

Once again the children and I are fighting a battle using spring grasses.
Now advancing, now retreating, each time with more refinement.
Twilight—everyone has returned home;
The bright, round moon helps me endure the loneliness.

LISTENING to the evening rain in my hermitage.
The Great Way? I braid spring flowers into a ball.
The future? If a visitor brings these questions
I have only the tranquillity of the hermitage to offer.

A THOUSAND peaks covered with frozen snow,
Ten thousand mountain paths, yet no sign of human beings.
Every day, only zazen;
Sometimes the sound of snow blowing against the window.
 
 
Late at night, the faint sound of someone pounding rice.
Dew drips from the bamboo onto the firewood pile
And the plants along the garden are also moist.
Frogs croak in the distance but then seem very close.
Fireflies light low, then high.
Wide awake; sleep is far off.
Smoothing out the pillow, I let my thoughts drift.
 

  
The ninth month has just begun; as we walk to Matsuno-o
A solitary goose flies overhead
And the chrysanthemums are in full bloom.
The children and I have come to this pine forest.
We have only walked a short distance
But the world is hundreds of miles away.

STANDING alone beneath a solitary pine;
Quickly the time passes.
Overhead the endless sky—
Who can I call to join me on this path?

TWILIGHT—smoke rises from the village,
A winter goose cries overhead,
Wind blows through the mountain pines.
Alone, carrying an empty rice bowl,
I return along the path.

IN THE empty doorway many petals are scattered;
As they fall they blend with the song of the birds.
Slowly, the bright spring sun appears in the window
And a thin line of smoke drifts from the incense burner.

SOARING birds disappear over the distant mountains,
Leaves fall continually in the quiet garden.
Lonely autumn breezes.
An old monk in his black robe, I stand alone.

LYING ill in my hermitage; all day not a single visitor.
My rice bowl has been hanging on the wall undisturbed for a long time,
And the wisteria has completely faded.
Dreams come, and drift over the fields and mountains.
My spirit returns to the village,
Where the children wait every day for me to come and play.

THE FIREPLACE is cold, covered with thick ashes.
Again the single light has gone out.
Loneliness, and the night is only half over.
Silence—all I can hear is the voice of a distant mountain stream.

THE SKY above, the mountains below;
Weak tea and thin soup are all I serve.
All year not one wise man,
Only an occasional woodgatherer.

RETURNING home after a day of begging;
Sage has covered my door.
Now a bunch of green leaves burns together with the firewood.
Silently I read the poems of Kanzan,
Accompanied by the autumn wind blowing a light rain that rustles through the reeds.
I stretch out both feet and lie down.
What is there to think about? What is there to doubt?

I have returned to my native village after twenty years;
No sign of old friends or relatives—they have all died or gone away.
My dreams are shattered by the sound of the temple bell struck at sunrise.
An empty floor, no shadows; the light has long been extinguished.

WHO SAYS my poems are poems?
My poems are not poems.
After you know my poems are not poems,
Then we can begin to discuss poetry!

INTERMITTENT rain—in my hermitage
A solitary light flickers as dreams return.
Outside, the sound of falling raindrops.
My black, gnarled staff leans against the wall.
The fireplace is cold, no charcoal awaits my imagined visitors.
I reach for a volume of poems.
Tonight, in solitude, deep emotion.
How can I explain it the following day?

IN FRONT of my window there is a towering banana tree,
So high it seems to sweep away the clouds.
Its shade keeps my hut cool.
As I read waka, write poems, and
Sit quietly, the day passes serenely.

ILLUSION and enlightenment? Two sides of a coin.
Universals and particulars? No difference.
All day I read the wordless sutra;
All night not a thought of Zen practice.
An uguisu sings in the willows along the river bank,
Dogs in the village bay at the moon.
There are no obstacles in my heart,
But still I lack a true companion.
 

MY GATE has been unbolted for many days,
Yet no sign of anyone entering the peaceful garden.
The rainy season is over, green moss is all around;
Slowly the oak leaves float to earth.

STAFF in hand, I walk along the river bank toward the village.
Snow lingers on the fence, but the east wind brings the first news of spring.
The voice of an uguisu drifts from tree to tree;
The grass has begun to show a touch of dark green.
Unexpectedly, I meet an old friend.
We converse together sitting on a hill overlooking the river valley.
Later, at his cottage we open many books and drink tea.
Tonight I am translating the evening scene into verse—
Plum blossoms and poetry, how wonderful together!

LYING ill again, for the third spring in a row.
How I would like just one poem left by a visitor.
Last year I played with the children all day at Hachiman Shrine.
Will they be waiting for me this year?

A LONELY four-mat hut—
All day no one in sight.
Alone, sitting beneath the window,
Only the continual sound of falling leaves.

FIRST days of spring—blue sky, bright sun.
Everything is gradually becoming fresh and green.
Carrying my bowl, I walk slowly to the village.
The children, surprised to see me,
Joyfully crowd about, bringing
My begging trip to an end at the temple gate.
I place my bowl on top of a white rock and
Hang my sack from the branch of a tree.
Here we play with the wild grasses and throw a ball.
For a time, I play catch while the children sing;
Then it is my turn.
Playing like this, here and there, I have forgotten the time.
Passers-by point and laugh at me, asking,
“What is the reason for such foolishness?”
No answer I give, only a deep bow;
Even if I replied, they would not understand.
Look around! There is nothing besides this.

ON THE way to visit a famous villa several ri distant,
I unexpectedly meet a woodgatherer.
Together we walk along the narrow path hemmed in by green pines.
The fragrance of plum blossoms drifts from the field opposite the valley.
Seeking a quiet place, I have come here.
Large carp frolic in the ancient pond,
Sunlight fills the calm forest.
What is this room?
Nothing but several volumes of poetry lying on the floor.
Feeling at home, I loosen my robe
And gather a few verses from the books.
Later, at twilight, I walk along the eastern corridor as spring birds soar overhead.

AS A boy I studied the Chinese classics but soon grew weary of their content.
As a young man I learned Zen but failed to transmit it.
Now living next door to a shrine,
Half Shinto priest, half Buddhist monk.

MY HUT lies in the middle of a dense forest;
Every year the green ivy grows longer.
No news of the affairs of men,
Only the occasional song of a woodcutter.
The sun shines and I mend my robe;
When the moon comes out I read Buddhist poems.
I have nothing to report, my friends.
If you want to find the meaning, stop chasing after so many things.

A COLD night—sitting alone in my empty room
Filled only with incense smoke.
Outside, a bamboo grove of a hundred trees;
On the bed, several volumes of poetry.
The moon shines through the top of the window,
And the entire neighborhood is still except for the cry of insects.
Looking at this scene, limitless emotion,
But not one word.

I HAVE returned to Itoigawa, my former village.
Falling ill, I rest at an inn
And listen to the sound of rain.
One robe, one bowl, are all I have.
Becoming a little stronger, I lift my weak body,
Burn some incense, and sit in zazen.
All night rain falls sadly, and
I dream of my pilgrimage these past ten years.

Midautumn—the wind and rain are now at their most melancholy.
A wanderer, my spirit is inseparable from this difficult road.
During the long night, dreams float from the pillow—
Awake suddenly, I have mistaken the sound of the river for the voice of the rain.

CARRYING firewood on my shoulder
I walk in the green mountains along the bumpy path.
I stop to rest under a tall pine;
Sitting quietly, I listen to the spring song of the birds.

EARLY summer—floating down a clear running river in a wooden boat,
A lovely girl gently plays with a crimson lotus flower held in her white hands.
The day becomes more and more brilliant.
Young men play along the shore
And a horse runs by the willows.
Watching quietly, speaking to no one,
The beautiful girl does not show that her heart is broken.

SINCE I came to this hermitage
How many years have passed?
If I am tired I stretch out my feet;
If I feel fine I go for a stroll in the mountains.
The ridicule or praise of worldly people means nothing.
Following my destiny, for this body I have received from my parents
I have only thanks.

NEAR a Kannon temple, I have a temporary hermitage;
Alone, yet the intimate friend of a thousand green poems written on the surrounding foliage.
Sometimes in the morning I put on my priest’s mantle
And go down to the village to beg food for this old body.

AT NIGHT, deep in the mountains I sit in zazen.
The affairs of men never reach here.
In the stillness I sit on a cushion across from the empty window.
The incense has been swallowed up by the endless night;
My robe has become a garment of white dew.
Unable to sleep, I walk into the garden;
Suddenly, above the highest peak, the round moon appears.

DAY AND night the cold wind blows through my robe.
In the forest, only fallen leaves;
Wild chrysanthemums can no longer be seen.
Next to my hermitage there is an ancient bamboo grove;
Never changing, it awaits my return.

ONCE AGAIN, many greedy people appear
No different from silkworms wrapped in cocoons.
Wealth and riches are all they love,
Never giving their minds or bodies a moment’s rest.
Every year their natures deteriorate
While their vanity increases.
One morning death comes before
They can use even half their money.
Others happily receive the estate,
And the deceased’s name is soon lost in darkness.
For such people there can only be great pity.

MY HUT, located in a distant village, is little more than four bare walls.
Once I was a mendicant monk, wandering here and there, staying nowhere long.
Recalling the first day of my pilgrimage, years ago—
How high my spirits were!

THE AUTUMN nights have lengthened
And the cold has begun to penetrate my mattress.
My sixtieth year is near,
Yet there is no one to take pity on this weak old body.
The rain has finally stopped; now just a thin stream trickles from the roof.
All night the incessant cry of insects:
Wide awake, unable to sleep,
Leaning on my pillow, I watch the pure bright rays of sunrise.

Today, while begging food, a sudden downpour.
I waited out the storm in a small shrine.
Laughing—one jug for water, one bowl for rice.
My life is like an old run-down hermitage—poor, simple, quiet.

IN THE entire ten quarters of the Buddha land
There is only one vehicle.
When we see clearly, there is no difference in all the teachings.
What is there to lose? What is there to gain?
If we gain something, it was there from the beginning.
If we lose anything, it is hidden nearby.
Look at the ball in the sleeve of my robe.
Surely it has great value.

TRULY, I love this life of seclusion.
Carrying my staff, I walk toward a friend’s cottage.
The trees in his garden, soaked by the evening rain,
Reflect the cool, clear autumnal sky.
The owner’s dog comes to greet me;
Chrysanthemums bloom along the fence.
These people have the same spirit as the ancients;
An earthen wall marks their separation from the world.
In the house volumes of poetry are piled on the floor.
Abandoning worldliness, I often come to this tranquil place—
The spirit here is the spirit of Zen.

LODGING at an old temple:
The night has ended, the room is empty.
The bitter cold has kept me from dreaming;
Sitting quietly, I wait for the temple bell to strike.

ALWAYS, when I was a boy,
I would play here and there.
I used to put on my favorite vest
And ride a chestnut horse with a white nose.
Today I spent the morning in town
And the evening drinking amid the peach blossoms by the river.
Returning home, I have lost my way. Where am I?
Laughing, I find myself next to the brothel.

AT THE main crossroads, playing Hotei,
Coming and going with my bowl. How many years have passed?
Pretending again I do not know where I am going;
A fresh wind blows and the bright moon covers the autumn sky.

SITTING quietly on a rough stone,
I watch clouds gather in all directions.
A golden pagoda gleams in the sun.
Below, Ryūō Spring, where one can wash both body and spirit.
Above, thousand-year-old pines.
A fresh breeze brings the day to an end.
I long to walk with another who has left the world far behind—but no one comes.

AFTER walking for a time, I reach the pavilion;
The sun sets behind the western mountains.
Willow leaves cover the little garden;
The pond is cold and the lotuses have faded.
Persimmon and chestnut trees, ripe with fruit, shade the path.
Along the bamboo fence, crickets cry incessantly;
Light filters easily through the pines and oaks—
Summer slowly changes its face.

EVEN IF a man lives a hundred years
His life is like a floating weed, drifting with the waves
East and west continually, no time for rest.
Shakyamuni renounced nobility and devoted his life to
Preventing others from falling into ruin.
On the earth eighty years,
Proclaiming the Dharma for fifty,
Bestowing the sutras as an eternal legacy;
Today, still a bridge to cross over to the other shore.

IF YOU speak delusions, everything becomes a delusion;
If you speak the truth, everything becomes the truth.
Outside the truth there is no delusion,
But outside delusion there is no special truth.
Followers of Buddha’s Way!
Why do you so earnestly seek the truth in distant places?
Look for delusion and truth in the bottom of your own hearts

AN EVENING dream—everything must have been an illusion;
I cannot explain clearly even one part of what I saw.
Yet in the dream it seemed as if the truth were in front of my eyes.
This morning, awake, is it not the same dream?

WALKING along a narrow path at the foot of a mountain
I come to an ancient cemetery filled with countless tombstones
And thousand-year-old oaks and pines.
The day is ending with a lonely, plaintive wind.
The names on the tombs are completely faded,
And even the relatives have forgotten who they were.
Choked with tears, unable to speak,
I take my staff and return home.

PEACH blossoms cover both sides of the river bank like mist.
In spring, the deep blue river appears to be the stream of Heaven.
Wandering here and there gazing at the peach blossoms as I follow the flow of the river—
What is this? An old friend’s house!

Spring—late at night I go for a walk.
A trace of snow lingers on the pines and cedars.
The bright moon hangs over the mountains.
I think of you, many rivers and mountains away;
Countless thoughts, but the brush does not move.

THE LONG summer days at Entsū-ji temple!
Everything is fresh and pure, and
Worldly emotions never come here.
I sit in the cool shade, reading poems.
Beauty all around: I endure the heat, listening to
The sound of the water wheel.

SILVER-WHITE snow envelops the mountains.
Far from the village, my gate is hidden by thick weeds.
Midnight: a piece of wood burns slowly in the hearth.
An old man with a long, white, twisted beard—
My thoughts keep returning to the days of my youth.
 
 
In the blue sky a winter goose cries.
The mountains are bare; nothing but falling leaves.
Twilight: returning along the lonely village path
Alone, carrying an empty bowl.
 
Foolish and stubborn—what day can I rest?
Lonely and poor, this life.
Twilight: I return from the village
Again carrying an empty bowl.

The bright moon emerges over the eastern mountains.
Walking by your former house—
You are gone, yet I think of you always.
Now no one brings the koto and sakè.

Concealed in a dense forest, my hermitage lies far beyond the village river.
A thousand peaks, ten thousand mountain streams, yet no sign of anyone.
A long, cold winter’s night—slowly a piece of wood burns in the fireplace.
Nothing can be heard except the sound of snow striking the window.

WHO CAN sympathize with my life?
My hut lies near the top of a mountain,
And the path leading here is covered with weeds.
On the fence, a single gourd.
From across the river, the sound of logging.
Ill, I lie on the pillow and watch the sunrise.
A bird cries in the distance—
My only consolation.

THE NUMBER of days since I left the world and
Entrusted myself to Heaven is long forgotten.
Yesterday, sitting peacefully in the green mountains;
This morning, playing with the village children.
My robe is full of patches and
I cannot remember how long I have had the same bowl for begging.
On clear nights I walk with my staff and chant poems;
During the day I spread out a straw mat and nap.
Who says many cannot lead such a life?
Just follow my example.

FINISHING a day of begging,
I return home through the green mountains.
The setting sun is hidden behind the western cliffs
And the moon shines weakly on the stream below.
I stop by a rock and wash my feet.
Lighting some incense, I sit peacefully in zazen.
Again a one-man brotherhood of monks;
Ah . . . how quickly the stream of time sweeps by.
 
 
A thief has stolen my zafu and futon.
Why did he break into my hermitage? The door is never locked.
The night is ending, and I sit alone by the window—
A sparse rain falls gently against the bamboo grove.

BUDDHA is your mind
And the Way goes nowhere.
Don’t look for anything but this.
If you point your cart north
When you want to go south,
How will you arrive?

 
THEY SAY spring has come
and the sky is filled with mist,
Yet on the mountains, no flowers, only snow.

AWAKENED by the cold—a light snow falls;
the sound of wild geese.
They also are returning home with hardship and suffering.

STANDING on a cliff, among the pines and oaks;
spring has come
Clothed in mist.

EARLY spring—picking vegetables;
a pheasant cries—
Old memories return.

SPRING flows gently—
the plum trees have bloomed.
Now the petals fall, mingling with the song of an uguisu.

ONLY TWO in the garden:
plum blossoms at their peak
And an old man full of years.

COUNTING days is like snapping
one’s fingers—
Even May passes like a dream.

AT YAHIKO Mountain
you can see
Both flowers and children bloom.

PICKING violets by the side of the road,
I forgot my begging bowl.
How sad you must be, my poor little bowl!

I FORGOT my bowl again!
Please, nobody pick it up,
My lonely little bowl.

SPRING has begun!
Jewels and precious gold everywhere!
Please come visit me!

THE SPRING birds have all returned
and their song drifts from every tree—
Let’s have another cup of sakè.

TONIGHT the plum trees reflect the silver moon;
both are in full bloom.
Entranced, I did not return home till evening.

EVERYWHERE you look
the mountains are covered
With mist and blooming cherry trees.

HOW CAN we ever lose interest in life?
Spring has come again
And cherry trees bloom in the mountains.

GOING out to beg this spring day
I stopped to pick violets—
Oh! The day is over!

GAILY the warm spring days pass;
playing with the children
In the forest below the shrine.

I HAVE entrusted myself to sakè and flowers:
today sakè-sakè,
Tomorrow sakè-sakè.

 
PLAYING ball with the village children
this warm, misty spring day;
No one wants it to end.

I CAME to this village to see the peach blossoms
but spent the day instead
Looking at the flowers along the river bank.

IN MY bowl
violets and dandelions are mixed
Together with the Buddhas of the three worlds.

THIRSTY, I’ve filled myself with sakè;
lying beneath the cherry blossoms—
Splendid dreams.

SPRING has come, the trees are in bloom,
last autumn’s leaves have disappeared—
I must hurry to meet the children.

BENEATH the willows, singing and laughing
with my friends; this fine spring day
Is truly full of joy.

I EXPECTED to see only pink blossoms,
but a gentle spring snow has fallen
and the cherry trees are wearing a white coat.

HAND IN hand, the children and I
pick spring vegetables—
What can be more wonderful?

PLAYING in a garden, among the cherry trees;
my sleeves are covered with blossoms
As the flowers fall.

THE CHILDREN run to greet me
for the first time this spring—
How they have grown!
 
 
IN THE distance
frogs croak in the mountain rice fields,
The evening’s single song.

SUMMER evening—the voice of a hototogisu
rises from the mountains
As I dream of the ancient poets.

NOW THE farmers are planting rice;
in my hermitage
I ask Buddha to bless them.

THE RAINY season is over—it’s now clear.
I go out;
Green fields and cool breezes everywhere.

UNABLE to sleep,
I hear the voice of a young deer
Rising from a mountain ridge.

THE BRANCHES that will be used for this
autumn’s firewood are still blooming.
Please gather some summer grasses, wet with dew,
and come visit me.

NOT MUCH to offer you—
just a lotus flower floating
In a small jar of water.

TRAVELING to a distant country
accompanied by a hototogisu
And thoughts of the sadness in this world.

THE CLOUDS have drifted away,
a hototogisu cries in the brush.
Why haven’t you come?

I STRETCH out for a nap in my little hut.
In the fields, frogs chant their songs
And the birds in the bamboo grove sing along.

IN THE pond near my hut
the lotus flowers, covered with dew,
Bloom in a row.

WORKING with their hands, the young girls chant
a plaintive song as they
Plant rice in the mountain fields.

THE BAMBOO grove in front of my hut!
Every day I see it a thousand times
Yet never tire of it.

BACK AND forth, back and forth,
all day the bent old man
Carries water for the parched rice seedlings.

I SEEM to hear your voice in the
song of the hototogisu.
In the mountains, another day passes.

THE WILLOWS are in full bloom!
I want to pile up the blossoms
Like mountain snow.

MY HERMITAGE lies in a forest;
all around me
Everything is thick and green.
 
 
LONELY, I leave my hermitage;
the rice, heavy with ripe grains,
Flutters in the autumn wind.

PLEASE wait for the light of the moon—
the mountain path
Is covered with fallen chestnuts.

THE WIND has brought
enough fallen leaves
To make a fire.

A COLD autumn night—
I clutch my white robe;
The bright, clear moon covers the sky.

THE WIND is fresh, the moon bright.
Let us spend the evening dancing
As a farewell to old age.

WHILE I gather firewood and wild grasses on this hill,
the Buddhas of the three worlds
Are also celebrating.

DURING a lull in the autumn rains,
I walk with the children along the mountain path.
The bottom of my robe becomes soaked with dew.

ALONG the cedar-lined path of an old shrine
I gather leaves
As the sun sets.

WHEN IT is evening, please come to my hut
to listen to the insects sing;
I will also introduce you to the autumn fields.

TWILIGHT—crossing Kugami Mountain,
shivering;
Fallen leaves all around.

FROM TODAY the nights turn colder—
I sew my tattered robe,
The autumn insects cry.

BRIGHT moon—I walk through the rice fields
near my hermitage;
In the distance, mountains clothed in mist.

MORNING—cutting firewood, filling my jug
with pure water, gathering wild grasses
While a cool autumn rain gently falls.

IF YOUR hermitage is deep in the mountains
surely the moon, flowers, and momiji
Will become your friends.
 
The momiji is the Japanese maple, with small leaves that turn a brilliant crimson in autumn.

NOW THAT autumn has formed its
first frost on my shabby robe,
It’s certain no visitors will come.

I’VE LEFT the world far behind,
my robe is covered with moss;
A small bundle of firewood burns, brightening the night.

MIDAUTUMN—the mountains are crimson
and the sakè and ink are ready,
But still no visitors.

THE VILLAGE has disappeared in the evening mist
and the path is hard to follow.
I return to my lonely hut, walking through the pines.
 
 
DRINKING sweet sakè with the farmers
until our eyebrows
Are white with snow.

RETURNING to my hermitage after a journey
to distant mountain villages;
Along the fence, the last chrysanthemums linger.

LATE AT night, listening to the winter rain,
recalling my youth—
Was it only a dream? Was I really young once?

THE HOUR grows late, but the sound of hail
striking the bamboo
Keeps me from sleep.

ANOTHER blizzard—the mountains are
covered with deep snow.
From now on, news from town must wait till spring.

I LIVE in a hut in the mountains of Echigo,
white peaks all around.
Ice, snow, and clouds blend together.

IN EVEN a light snow, we can see
the three thousand worlds.
Again a light snow falls.

WIND AND snow, then snow and rain:
tonight, awakened by the cry of a wild goose
In the dark, endless winter sky.

LYING in my freezing hut, unable to sleep;
only the quiet roar
Of water pouring over a cliff.

I WENT to see the pine at Iwamura.
All day I stood in the rice field
Getting drenched by freezing rain.

I LIE down near the hearth
and stretch out my feet to the fire,
But still the cold pierces my belly.

NO BEGGING in the town
again today.
The snow falls and falls.

LATE AT night, the snow
is piling higher and higher,
Muffling the sound of the waterfall.

THE FREEZING morning rain has let up.
What should I do?
Fetch water? Chop firewood? Gather winter greens?

IN THE shadow of the mountains
the firewood burns, brightening
My cold little grass hut.

WINTER will soon be over;
please, please come visit
My grass hut.

MY HEART beats faster and faster
and I cannot sleep.
Tomorrow will be the first day of spring!
 
 
 
THE CLOUDS are gone, the sky is clear.
To beg food with a pure heart
Is indeed a blessing from Heaven.

SINGING waka, reciting poems, playing ball
together in the fields—
Two people, one heart.

LYING on my grass pillow,
dreaming about this dream world again—
Lonely, fitful sleep.

AS I WATCH the children happily playing,
without realizing it,
My eyes fill with tears.

THINKING about the people in this floating world
far into the night—
My sleeve is wet with tears.

THE THIEF left it behind—
the moon
At the window.
 
 
WHO IS there to take pity on this old body?
The sun sets as I return to get the staff
I left behind.

PRIEST Ryōkan must fade
like this morning’s flowers,
But his heart will remain behind.

WAITING for a visitor, I drank four or five
cups of this splendid sakè.
Already completely drunk, I’ve forgotten who is coming. Next time be more careful!

O, THAT my priest’s robe were wide enough
to gather up all the suffering people
In this floating world.

HAVE YOU forgotten the way to my hut?
Every evening I wait for the sound of your footsteps,
But you do not appear.

IN THE vast sky the sun is setting;
the path home is far
And the bag is already heavy.

FORM, color, name, design—
even these are things of this floating world
And should be abandoned.

WHEN I think about the sadness of the people
in this world,
Their sadness becomes mine.

TWILIGHT—the only conversation
on this hill
Is the wind blowing through the pines.

THE ISLAND of Sado—
morning and evening I often see it in my dreams,
Together with the gentle face of my mother.

OUR LIVES are like the plants
floating along the water’s edge
Illumined by the moon.

 
WHAT IS the heart of this old monk like?
A gentle wind
Beneath the vast sky.

OUR BODIES will rot and fade away,
but the fruit of the Buddhist Law
Cannot be discarded.

WE SEE only a straw hat and raincoat,
but still the scarecrow
Does his job.

TO FIND the Buddhist Law,
drift east and west, come and go,
Entrusting yourself to the waves.

THE SEAWEED from Nozomi near Kotoshi!
Day and night
I dream of its wonderful taste.

MONTHS pass, days pile up,
like one intoxicated dream—
An old man sighs.

Death in itself is nothing; but we fear
To be we know not what, we know not where.

My robe
grows heavy
with the scent of blossoms.

Autumn sunset:
a deer's call
echoes over fields.

The sun goes down
behind the mountain peaks
and bells ring.

My storehouse burned down—
now nothing stands between me
and the moon above.
