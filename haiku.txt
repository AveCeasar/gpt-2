2 traveling salesmen
   passing each other
On a Western road

50 miles from N.Y.
   all alone in Nature,
The squirrel eating

A balloon caught
   in the tree – dusk
In Central Park zoo

Abbid abbayd ingrat
   - Lighthouse
On the Azores

A black bull
   and a white bird
Standing together on the shore

A big fat flake
   of snow
Falling all alone

A bird hanging
   on the wire
At dawn

A bird on
   the branch out there
- I waved

A bird pecking kernels
   on a grassy hillside
Just mowed

A bottle of wine, 
   a bishop -
Everything is God

A bubble, a shadow -
   woop -
The lightning flash

A car is coming but
   the cat knows
It's not a snake

A current pimple
   In the mind’s
Old man

After a year and a half
   finally saw the rat
Big and fat

After supper
   on crossed paws,
The cat meditates

After the earthquake,
   A child crying
In the silence

After the shower,
   among the drenched roses,
the bird thrashing in the bath

After the shower
   my cat meowing
on the porch

After the shower
   the red roses
In the green, green

A full November moon
   and mild,
Mary Carney

Ah, Genghiz Khan
   weeping – where
did Autumn go?

Ah Jerusalem – how many
   Autumn saints slaughtered
Thee with Christ?

Ah the birds
   at dawn, 
my mother and father

Ah, the crickets
   are screaming
at the moon

Ah who cares?
   I’ll do what I want -
Roll another joint

All day long wearing 
   a hat that wasn't 
On my head

All I see is what
   I see -
Red fire sunset

All that ocean of blue
   soon as those clouds
Pass away

All the insects ceased
   in honor
Of the moon

All these sages
   Sleep
with their mouths open

All the wash 
   on the line
Advanced one foot

Alone at home reading
   Yoka Daishi,
Drinking tea

Alone, in old
   clothes, sipping wine
Beneath the moon

A long island
   in the sky
The Milky Way

A long way from
   The Beat Generation
In the rain forest

Alpine fir with
   snowcap’t backround –
It doesn’t matter

America: fishing licenses
   the license
To meditate

Am I a flower
   bee, that you
Stare at me?

A million acres
   of Bo-trees
And not one Buddha

Among the nervous birds
   the morning dove
Nibbles quietly

A mother & son
   just took a shortcut
Thru my yard

Ancient ancient world
   - tight skirts
By the new car

And as for Kennedy -
   in Autumn he slept
By swishing peaceful trees

And the quiet cat
   sitting by the post
Perceives the moon

Answered a letter
   and took a hot bath
- Spring rain

Apassionata Sonata
   - hiballs, gray
Afternoon in October

April mist -
   under the pine
At midnight

A pussywillow grew there
   At the foot
Of the breathless tree

A quiet Autumn night
   and these fools
Are starting to argue

A quiet moment -
   low lamp, low logs -
Just cooking the stew

A raindrop from
   the roof
Fell in my beer

Arms folded
   to the moon,
Among the cows

A spring mosquito
   dont even know
How to bite!

As the cool evenings
   make themselves felt,
Smoke from suburban chimneys

Asking Albert Saijo
   for a haiku,
He said nothing

A stump with sawdust
   - a place
To meditate

At a Coney Island
   hamburger
In Vancouver Washington

At night
   The girl I denied
Walking away

A turtle sailing along
   on a log,
Head up

Aurora borealis
   over Mount Hozomeen -
The world is eternal

Aurora Borealis
   over the Hozomeen –
The void is stiller

Autumnal cowflops -
   a man
Makes a living.

Autumnal
Cowflops -
but a man must
make a living.

Autumn eve – my
   mother playing old
Love songs on the piano

Autumn night in New Haven
   - the Whippenpoofers
Singing on the train

Autumn night
   low moon -
Fire in Smithtown

Autumn night
   Salvation Army sign
On a cold brick building

Autumn night stove
- I’ve never been
on a farm before.

Autumn nite 
   - Lucien leans to Jack
on the couch.

Autumn nite -
Lucien’s wife
Playing the guitar

Autumn nite -
my mother cuts her throat

Autumn nite -
my mother remembers
my birth

Autumn nite -
the boys
playing haiku.

August in Salinas -
   Autumn leaves in
Clothing store displays

August moon - oh
   I got a boil
On my thigh

August Moon Universe
   - neither new
Nor old

A whole pussywillow
   over there,
Unblown

A yellow witch chewing
   a cigarette,
Those Autumn leaves

Bach through an open
   dawn window -
the birds are silent

Barefoot by the sea,
   stopping to scratch one ankle
With one toe

Barley soup in Scotland
   in November -
Misery everywhere

Bee, why are you
   staring at me?
I'm not a flower!

Beautiful young girls running
   up the library steps
With shorts on

Beautiful summer night
   gorgeous as the robes
Of Jesus

Big books packaged
   from Japan -
Ritz crackers

Big drinking & piano
   parties – Christmas
Come and gone –

Big wall of clouds
   from the North
Coming in – brrrr!

Bird bath trashing,
   by itself -
Autumn wind

Birds chirp
   fog
Bugs the gate

Birds flew
   Over the shack
Rejoicing

Birds flying north -
   Where are the squirrels?
There goes a plane to Boston

Birds singing
   in the dark
In the rainy dawn

Bird suddenly quiet
   on his branch – his 
Wife glancing at him

Bird was gone
   and distance grew
Immensely white

Black bird - no!
   bluebird - pear
Branch still jumping

Blizzard in the suburbs
   - the mailman
And the poet walking

Blizzard in the suburbs
   - old man driving slowly
To the store 3 blocks

Blizzard’s just started
   all that bread scattered,
And just one bird

Blowing in an afternoon wind,
   on a white fence,
A cobweb

Blueberry dubbery
   the chipmunk’s
In the grass

Bluejay drinking at my
   saucer of milk,
Throwing his head back

Breakfast done
   the tomcat curls up
On the down couch

Bred to rejoice,
   the giggling
sunshine leaves

Brighter than the night,
   my barn roof
Of snow

Brokenback goodshit
Heap bigshot
among the Birchtrees.

Buddha laughing
   on Mt. Lanka!
Like Jimmy Durante!

Buddhas in moonlight
   - Mosquito bite
thru hole in my shirt

Buds in the snow
  - the deadly fight
between two birds

Butterfat soil
   of the valley -
Big black slugs

But the Lost Creek trail
   they dont believe
Is in existence any more

Came down from my
   ivory tower
And found no world

Cat eating fish heads
   - All those eyes
In the starlight
Catfish fighting for his life,
   and winning,
Splashing us all
Cat gone 24 hours
   - A piece of his hair
Waving on the door

Change Su Chi’s art
   studio, a silent
Shade in the window

Chief Crazy Horse
   looks tearfully north
The first snow flurries

Chipmunk went in
   - butterfly
Came out

Chou en Lai, his briefcase
   should be fulla leaves,
For all I know

Christ on the Cross crying
   - his mother missed
Her October porridge

Churchbells ringing in town
   - The caterpillar
In the grass

Close your eyes -
   Landlord knocking
On the back door

Closing the book,
   rubbing my eyes -
The sleepy August dawn

Cloudy autumn nite
- cold water drips
in the sink.

Coffee beans!
   - Methinks I smell
The Canaries!

Cold crisp October morning
   - the cats fighting
In the weeds

Cold gray tufts
   of winter grass
Under the stars

Coming from the West,
   covering the moon,
Clouds – not a sound

Concatenation! – the bicycle
   pulls the wagon
Because the rope is tied

Content, the top trees
   shrouded
In gray fog

Cool breeze - maybe
   just a shillyshallying snow
That'll ruin everything

Cool breezy morning
   - the cat is rolling
On his back

Cool sunny autumn day,
   I’ll mow the lawn
one last time

Cradled and warm,
   the upper snow,
The trackless

Crisp wind
   My tired limbs
Relaxed before the coals

Crossing the football field,
   coming home from work,
The lonely businessman

Dawn, a falling star
   - A dewdrop lands
On my head!

Dawn – crows cawing,
   ducks quack quacking,
Kitchen windows lighting

Dawn – the first
   robins singing
to the new moon

Dawn – the tomcat
   hurrying home
With his tail down

Dawn – the writer who
   hasn’t shaved,
Poring over notebooks

Dawn wind
   in the spruces
- The late moon

Debris on the lake
   - my soul
Is upset

Desk cluttered
   with mail -
My mind is quiet

Desolation, Desolation,
   so hard
To come down off of

Desolation, Desolation,
   wherefore have you
Earned you name?

Disturbing my mind essence,
   all that food
I have to cook

Do you know why my name is Jack?
   Why?
That’s why.

Drinking wine
   - the Queen of Greece
on a postage stamp

Drizzle -
   Midnight pine,
I sit dry

Drunk as a hoot owl
   writing letters
By thunderstorm

Drunken deterioration -
   ho-hum,
Shooting star

Dusk - boy
   smashing dandelions
With a stick

Dusk in the holy
   woods -
Dust on my window

Dusk now –
   what’s left of
An ancient pier

Dusk - the bird
   on the fence
A contemporary of mine

Dusk – The blizzard
   hides everything,
Even the night

Early morning gentle rain,
   two big bumblebees
Humming at their work

Early morning with the
   happy dogs -
I forgot the Path

Early morning yellow flowers
   - Thinking about
The drunkards of Mexico

Elephants munching
   on grass - loving
Head side by side

Eleven quick skulks
   to Fall
And still cool

Emptiness
   of the Ananda glass bead,
Is the bowing weeds

Empty baseball field
   - A robin,
Hops along the bench

Evening coming -
   The office girl
unloosing her scarf

Everlastingly loose
   and responsive,
The cloud business

Every cat in Kyoto
   can see through the fog

Everyone of my knocks
   disturbs my daughter
Sleeping in her December grave

Everywhere beyond
   the Truth,
Empty space blue

February dawn – frost
   on the path
Where I paced all winter

February gales - racing
   westward through
The clouds, the moon

Fiddlydee! -
   Another day,
Another something-or-other!

Fighting over a peach
   stone, bluejays
In the bushes

First December cold
   wave - not even
One cricket

First frost dropped
   all leaves
Last night – leafsmoke

Flowers
   aim crookedly
At the straight death

For a moment
   the moon
Wore goggles

Following each other,
   my cats stop
When it thunders

Forever and forever
   everything’s alright -
midnight woods

Four bluejays quiet
   in the afternoon tree,
Occasionally scratching

Four in morning -
   creak my mother
In her bed

Free as a pine
   goofing
For the wind

Frogs don’t care
   just sit there
Brooding on the moon

Front hooves spread,
   the mule scratches his
Neck along a log

Frozen
   in the birdbath,
A leaf

Full moon in the trees
   - across the street,
the jail

Full moon of October
   - The tiny mew
of the Kitty

Full moon -
   Pine tree -
Old house

Full moon, white snow, -
   my bottle
Of purple jello

Gary  gone from the shack
   like smoke
- My lonely shoes

Gary Snyder
   is a haiku
far away

Gee last night -
   dreamed
Of Harry Truman

Geronimo, in Autumn
   says no to peaceful
Cochise - Smoke rises

Get to go -
   fork a hoss
And head for Mexico

Ghengis Khan looks fiercely
   east, with red eyes,
Hungering for Autumn vengeance

Girls' footprints
   in the sand
- Old mossy pile

Girl trapped beneath the
   steering wheel, beautiful
As the Dalai Lama’s dream

Girl with wagon -
   what do
I know?

Giving an apple
   to the mule, the big lips
Taking hold

Glow worms
   brightly sleeping
On my flowers

Glow worm sleeping 
   on this flower,
Your light's on!

God’s dream,
   It’s only
A dream

Grain Elevators are tall trucks
   that let the road
approach them

Grain Elevators on
   Saturday waiting for
The farmers to come home

Grain elevators, waiting
   for the road
To approach them

Grass waves,
   hens chuckle,
Nothing’s happening

Gray day -
   the blue spruce 
Is green

Gray orb of the moon
   behind silver clouds -
The Spanish moss

Gray spring rain
   - I never clipped
My hedges  

Greyhound bus,
   flowing all night,
Virginia

Gull sailing
   in the saffron sky -
The Holy Ghost wanted it

Haiku! Haiku!
   Still wears a bandage
Over his injured eye!

Haiku my eyes!
   my mother is calling!

Haiku, shmaiku, I cant
   understand the intention
of reality

Halloween colors
   orange and black
On a summer butterfly

Hand in hand in a red valley
   with the universal schoolteacher -
the first morning

Haunted Autumn visiting
   familiar August,
Those last 2 days

Haydn’s creation or
   Coleman Hawkins, I can
Fix em just right

Here comes
   My dragon -
goodbye!

Here comes the nightly
   moth, to his nightly
Death, at my lamp

Her yellow dolls bowing
   on the shelf -
My dead step grandmother

Highest perfect fool -
   the wisdom
Of the two-legged rat

High in the Sky
   the Fathers Send Messages
From on High

High noon
   in Northport
- Alien shore

Hitch hiked a thousand
   miles and brought
You wine

Hmf – Ole Starvation Ridge
   is
Milkied o’er

Holding up my purring 
   cat to the moon,
I sighed

Holy sleep
   - Hanshan
Was right

Horse waving his tail
   in a field of clover
At sundown

Hot coffee
   and a cigarette –
why zazen?

Hot tea, in the cold
   moonlit snow -
a burp

How cold! – late
   September baseball -
The crickets

How’d those guys
   get in here,
those two flies?

How many cats they need
   around here
For any orgy?

How flowers love
   the sun,
Blinking there!

How that butterfly’ll wake up
   When someone
Bongs that bell!

Huge knot in the
   Redwood tree
Looking like Zeus’ face

Hummingbird hums
   hello – bugs
Race and swoop

Hurrying things along,
   Autumn rain
On my awning

I called – Dipankara
   instructed me
By saying nothing

I called Hanshan
   in the fog -
Silence, it said

I called Hanshan
   in the mountains
- there was no answer

I close my eyes -
   I hear & see
Mandala

I don’t care -
   the low yellow
Moon loves me

I don’t care
   what
thusness is

I drink my tea
   and say
Hm hm

If I go out now,
   my paws
will get wet

I found my
   cat - one
Silent star

Ignoring my bread,
   the bird peeking
In the grass

I gotta make it in terms /that anyone can understand/
Did I tell ya about my nightmare?

I hate the ecstasy
   Of that rose,
That hairy rose

I'll climb up a tree
   and scratch Katapatafataya

I made raspberry fruit jello
   The color of rubies
In the setting sun

I’m back here in the middle
   of nowhere -
At least I think so

I’m so mad
   I could bite
The montaintops

In a Mojave dust storm
   Albert said: "Senzeie,
Was a Mongolian waif"

In Autumn Geronimo
   weeps - no pony
With a blanket

In back of the Supermarket,
   in the parking lot weeds,
Purple flowers

In enormous blizzard
   burying everything
My cat’s out mating

In enormous blizzard
   burying everything -
My cat turned back

In Hakkaido a cat
   has no luck

In London-town cats
   can sleep
In the butcher's doorway.

In my medicine cabinet
   the winter fly
Has died of old age

In the chair
   I decided to call Haiku
By the name of Pop

In the desert sun
   in Arizona,
A yellow railroad caboose

In the late afternoon
   peaks, I see
The hope

In the lovely sun
   reading lovely
Haikus - Spring

In the middle of
   the corn, a new
Car slithering

In the morning frost
   the cats
Stepped slowly

In the quiet house,
   my mother's
Moaning yawns

In the sun     
   the butterfly wings
Like a church window

Iowa clouds
   following each other
Into Eternity

I rubbed my bearded
   cheek and looked in
The mirror – Ki!

I said a joke
   under the stars
- No laughter

I should have scratched
   that spot before
I started to sleep

I’ve turned up
   the lamp again
- The sleeping moth

I went in the woods
   to meditate -
It was too cold

I woke up
   - two flies were boffing
On my forehead

Jack reads his book
aloud at nite
- the stars come out.

Juju [=juzu] beads on the
   Zen manual -
My knees are cold

June – the snow
   of blossoms
On the ground

Just woke up
   - afternoon pines
Playing the wind

Kicked the cupboard
   and hurt my toe
- Rage

Kneedeep in the
   blizzard, the ancient
Misery of the cat

Kneedeep, teeth
   to the blizzard,
My cat gazing at me

Late afternoon –
   it’s not the void
That changed

Late afternoon -
   my bare back’s
Cold

Late afternoon -
   the lake sparkle
Blinds me

Late afternoon -
   the mop is drying
On the rock

Late April
   dusk bluster -
Lions & lambs

Late autumn nite
the last faint cricket.

Late moon rising
   - Frost
On the grass

Lay the pencil
   away – no more
thoughts, no lead

Leaf dropping straight
   In the windless midnight:
The dream of change

Leaves falling everywhere
   in the November
Midnight moonshine

Leaves skittering on
   the tin roof
- August fog in Big Sur

Lilacs at dusk
   - one petal
fell

Listen to the birds sing!
   All the little birds
Will die!

Listening to birds using
   different voices, losing
My perspective of History

Little frogs screaming
   in the ditch
At nightfall

Little pieces of ice
   in the moonlight
Snow, thousands of em

Lonely brickwalls in Detroit
   Sunday afternoon
piss call

Lonesome blubbers
   grinding out the decades
with wet lips

Looking around to think
   I saw the thick white cloud
Above the house

Looking for my cat
   in the weeds,
I found a butterfly

Looking up at the stars,
   feeling sad,
Going "tsk tsk tsk" 

Looking up to see
   the airplane
I only saw the TV aerial

Lost cat Timmy -
   he wont be back
In a blue moon

Loves his own belly
   The way I love my life,
The white cat

Made hot cocoa
   at night,
Sang by woodfire

Man dying - 
   Harbor lights
On still water

Man – nothing but
   a
Rain barrel

Mao Tse Tung has taken
   too many Siberian sacred
Mushrooms in Autumn

May grass -
   Nothing much
To do

Mayonnaise -
   mayonnaise comes in cans
Down the river

Memère says: "Planets are
   far apart so people
Can't bother each other."

Me, my pipe,
   my folded legs -
Far from Buddha

Men and women
   Yakking beneath
the eternal Void

Mexico – After the dim
   markets, bright
San Juan Letran

Me, you – you, me
   Everybody -
He-he

Middle of my Mandala
   - Full moon
In the water

Mild spring night -
   a teenage girl said
"Good evening" in the dark

Missing a kick
   at the icebox door
It closed anyway

Mist before the peak
   - the dream
Goes on

Mist boiling from the
   ridge - the mountains
Are clean

Mist falling
   - Purple flowers
Growing

Mists blew by, I
   Closed my eyes, -
Stove did the talking

Misurgirafical & plomlied
   - ding dang
The Buddha’s gang

Moon behind
   Black clouds -
Silver seas

Moon in the
   bird bath -
One star too

Morning meadow -
   Catching my eye,
On weed

Morning sun -
   The purple petals,
Four have fallen

Moth sleeping
   on the newly plastered wall
- the spring rain

M’ugly spine – the loss
   of the kingdom
Of Heaven

Mule on the seashore
   One thousand foot
Bridge above

My blue spruce
   in the pale
Haze dusk

My butterfly came
   to sit in my flower,
Sir Me

My cat eating
   at his saucer
- Spring moon

My cat’s asleep
   - poor little angel,
the burden of flesh!

My Christ blinds
   are down -
I’m reading about Virgin

My corncub pipe
   hot from
the sun

My critics jiggle
   constantly like
Poison ivy in the rain

My flashlight,
   where I put it this afternoon
Twisted away in sleep

My friend standing
   in my bedroom -
The spring rain

My hand,
   A thing with hairs,
rising and falling with my belly

My hands on my lap
   June night,
Full moon

My Japanese blinds
   are down -
I’m reading about Ethiopia

My rumpled couch
   - The lady's voice
Next door

My rose arbor knows more
   about June
Than it'll know about winter

My pipe unlit
   beside the Diamond
Sutra - What to think?

Napoleon in bronze
   the burning Blakean
mountains

Nat Wills, a tramp
   - America
In 1905

Neons, Chinese restaurants
   coming on -
Girls come by shades

New aluminum
   grammar school
In old lamplight

New neighbors 
   - light
In the old house

Nibbling his ankle,
   the mule’s teeth
Like kettle drum

Nightfall,
   boy smashing dandelions
with a stick

Nightfall - too dark 
   to read the page,
Too cold

Night fall - too dark 
   to read the page,
Too dark

Night rain – neighbors
   Arguing loud voices
In next house

Night – six petals
   have fallen from
Bodhidharma’s bouquet

Nirvana, as when the rain
   puts out a little fire

No imaginary judgments
   of form,
The clouds

No telegram today
   - Only more 
Leaves fell

Nodding against the wall, 
   the flowers
Sneeze

Nose hairs in the moon
   - My ass
Is cold

November - how nasal
   the drunken
Conductor's call

November’s New Haven
   baggagemaster stiffly
Disregards my glance

November the seventh
   The last 
Faint cricket

Nored the Atlantican Astrologer
   weeps because the King
Laid his Autumn girl!

October night, lights
   of Connecticut towns
Across the sound

O for 
   Vermont again -
The barn on an Autumn night

Oh another weekend’s
   started – people squeaking
On U-turning tires

Oh I could drink up
   The whole Yellow River
In my love for Li Po!

Oh moon,
   such dismay?
- Earths betray

Old man dying in a room -
   Groan
At five o’clock

Old man of Aix
   white hair, beret -
Gone up the Cezanne street

On Desolation
   I was the alonest man
in the world

One drop from
   the blue spruce -
two more drops

One flower
   on the cliffside
Nodding at the canyon

One foot on the bar
   of soap,
The Bluejay peeking

On Starvation Ridge
   little sticks
Are trying to grow

On the sidewalk
   A dead baby bird
For the ants

OO a continent
   in a birdbath -
April full moon

Ooh! they kicked up
   a cloud of dust!
The birds in my yard

Or, walking the same or different
   paths
The moon follows each

O Sebastian, where art thou?
   Pa, watch over us!
Saints, thank you!

Peeking at the moon
   in January, Bodhisattva
Takes a secret piss

Perfect circle round
   the moon
In the center of the sky

Perfectly silent
   in the starry night,
the little tree

Perfect moonlit night
   marred
By family squabbles

Phantom Rose
   Lust
Is a Leopard

Pink petals on
   gnarly Japanese twigs
In rain

Playing basketball
   - the lady next door
Watching again

Poor gentle flesh -
   there is
No answer

Poor tortured teeth
   under
The blue sky

Protected by the clouds,
   the moon
Sleeps sailing

Prayerbeads
   on the Holy Book
- My knees are cold

Praying all the time -
   talking
To myself

Propped up on my shoe
   the Diamond Sutra -
Propped up on a pine root

Puddles at dusk
   - one drop
fell

Quietly pouring coffee
   in the afternoon,
How pleasant!

Quiet moonlit night -
   Neighbor boy studying
By telescope; - "Ooo!"

Racing westward through
   the clouds in the howling
wind, the moon

Rain in North Caroline
   - the saints
Are still meditating

Rain-in-the-Face
   looks from the hill:
Custer down there

Rain’s over, hammer on wood
   - this cobweb
Rides the sun shine

Rainy night,                     
   the top leaves wave          
In the grey sky

Rainy night
   - I put on
My pajamas

Reading my notes -
   The fly stepping from
The page to the finger

Reading the sutra
   I decided
To go straight

Red roses, white
   clouds, blue sky,
In my birdbath

Red trees -
the dog tears at
an old itch.

Reflected upsidedown
   in the sunset lake, pines,
Pointing to infinity

Resting watchfully, the cat
   and the squirrel
Share the afternoon

Rig rig rig -
   that’s the rat
On the roof

River wonderland –
   The emptiness
Of the golden eternity

Rock rosed – behind the Casbah
   - the sun has disappearing act

Roses! Roses!
   robin wants his
Evening bath!

Run after that
   body – run after
A raging fire

Run over my lawnmower,
   waiting for me to leave,
The frog

Samsara in the morning
   - puppy yipping,
Hot motor steaming

Satisfied, the pine
   bough washing
In the waters

Second thundershower
   over – the sun
Is still high

September raindrops
   from my roof -
Soon icicles

Seven birds in a tree,
   looking
In every direction

Sex – shaking to bread
   as
Providence permits

Shall I break God's commandment?
   Little fly
Rubbing its back legs

Shall I heed God’s commandment?
   - wave breaking
On the rocks -

Shall I say no?
   - fly rubbing
its back legs

She loves Lysander
   not Demetrius -
Who? - Hermia

Ship paint
   on
An old T-shirt

Shooting star! – no,
   lightning bug! -
ah, well, June night

Sitting Bull adjust
   his girdle: the smell
Of smoking fish

Silent pipe -
   peace and quiet
In my heart

Sitting in the sun,
   no bugs yet -
Yellow clover

Sixty sunsets have I seen
   revolve on this perpendicular hill

Skhandas my ass!
   - it’s not
Even that

Sleeping on my desk
   head on the sutras,
my cat

Smell of burning leaves,
   The quiet pool at evening 
In August

Snap your finger
   stop the world!
- Rain falls harder

Snow in my shoe
   Abandoned
Sparrow’s nest

Snow melting,
   streams rushing -
Lookout leave the valley

Snow on the grape
   arbor – the little
dead raisins

So humid you cant
   light matches, like
Living in a tank

Somebody rang my bell
   I said who?
O it doesn’t worldly care

Sometimes they sleep
   with their lights on,
the June bugs

Some trees still
   have naked winter look
- Spring day

Spring day -
   in my mind
Nothing

Spring dusk
   on Fifth Avenue,
A bird

Spring evening -
hobo with hard on
Like bamboo

Spring evening -
   the two
Eighteen year old sisters

Spring is coming
   Yep, all that equipment
for sighs

Spring moon
   on 2nd Avenue
- girl in white coat

Spring night -
   a leaf falling
From my chimney

Spring night – the gleam
   of the fish head eye
In the grass

Spring night
   the silence
Of the stars

Spring night – the sound
   of the cat
Chewing fish heads

Spring night -
   the neighbor hammering
In the new old house

Spring rain,
   Kicking stones
An arrowhead

Standing on the end
   on top of the tree,
The Big Dipper

Stare intently
   at my candle
- Pool of wax

Staring at each other,
   Squirrel in the branch,
Cat in the grass

Stop slipping me
   Your old Diamond Sutra
You illimitable tight-ass!

Straining at the padlock,
   the garage doors
At noon

Suddenly the official
   goes cross eyed
And floats away

Summer afternoon -
   impatiently chewing
The jasmine leaf

Summer night - 
   I put out
The empty milk bottle

Summer night - 
   the kitten playing
With the Zen calendar

Sunday in a bar
   in Woodland Calif.
- One noon beer

Sunday -
   the sky is blue,
The flowers are red

Sunny day – bird tracks
   & cat tracks
In the snow

Sun on the rocks -
   a fighting snag
Holds on

Sun shining on
   A distant mountain
- the low moon

Surprising cat fight
   in the parlor on a
Blustery September night

Sweet birds, chordless
   except in another 
Clime

Swinging on delicate hinges
   the Autumn Leaf
Almost off the stem

Taghagata [=Tathagata] neither loathes
   nor loves
His body’s milk or shit

Take up a cup of water
   from the ocean
And there I am

Temple trees
   across the creek
- Fog blowing

Terraces of fern
   in the dripping
Redwood shade

Thanks to Coolidge,
   Hoover – Hoover – but Autumn,
Roosevelt done America in

That's an unencouraging sign,
   the fish store
is closed

The Angel’s hair
   trailed on my chin
Like a cobweb

The ant struggles escaping
   from the web -
The spider’s non-comment

The backyard I tried to draw
   - It still looks
The same

The barking dog -
   Kill him
With a bicycle wheel

The barn, swimming
   in a sea
Of windblown leaves

The beautiful red
   dogwood tree
Waiting for the cross

The bird came on the branch
   - danced three times -
And burred away

The birds start singing
but he is in the cat meadows

The bird’s still on top
   of that tree,
High above the fog

The birds
   surprise me
On all sides

The book
   stands all by itself
on the shelf

The bottoms of my shoes
   are clean
From walking in the rain

The carpenter of spring
   the Zen
of hammer and nail

The castle of the Gandharvas
   is full of aging
Young couples

The cat: a little
   body being used
By a little person

The cat musing
   along the ground -
cold gray day

The clouds are
   following each other
Into Eternity

The clouds assume
   as I assume,
Faces of hermits

The cows of Autumn -
   laughing along the fence,
Roosters at Dawn

The cow, taking a big
   dreamy crap, turning
To look at me

The creamer gives,
   the groaner quakes -
the angel smiles

The cricket in my cellar window, this quiet
   Sunday afternoon

The crickets - crying
   for rain - 
Again?

The days go -
   They cant stay -
I don’t realize

The dog yawned
   and almost swallowed
My Dharma

The dregs of my coffee
   Glisten
In the morning light

The droopy constellation
   on the grassy hill -
Emily Dickinson’s Tomb

The earth keeps turning
   like a dreary
Immortal

The earth winked
   at me - right
In the john

The falling snow -
   The hissing radiators -
The bride out there

The flies on the porch
   and the fog on the peaks
Are so sad

The flowers don’t seem
   to mind
the stupid May sunshine

The fly, just as
   lonesome as I am
In this empty house

The full moon -
   the cat gone -
My sleeping mother

The gently moving
   leaves
Of the August afternoon

The Golden Gate
   creaks
With sunset rust

The hermit’s broom,
   the fire, the kettle
- August night

The housecats, amazed
   at something new,
Looking in the same direction

The jazz trombone,
   The moving curtain,
- Spring rain

The leaves, fighting
   the empty sky -
No clouds helping
THE LIGHT BULB
   SUDDENLY WENT OUT -
STOPPED READING
The little sparrow
   on my eave drainpipe
Is looking around

The little sparrow on the eave drainpipe
My heart flutters

The little white cat
   Walks in the grass
With his tail up in the air

The little worm
   lowers itself from the roof
By a self shat thread

The low yellow
   moon above 
The quiet lamplit house

The mansion of
   the moon
Has hidden faces

The microscopic red bugs
   in the sea-side sand
Do they meet and greet?

The mind of the flower
   regards my mind
Externally

The mist in front
   of the morning mountains
- late Autumn

The moon had
   a cat's mustache,
For a second

The moon
   is a
Blind lemon

The moon is moving,
   thru the clouds
Like a slow balloon

The moon is white -
   the lamps are
Yellow

The moon,
   the falling star
- Look elsewhere

The mountains
   are mighty patient,
Buddha-man

The mule, turning
   slowly, rubbing his
Behind on a log

The national scene
   - late afternoon sun
In those trees

The new moon
   is the toe nail
Of God

The night
   is red
with stars

”The old pond, yes!
   - the water jumped into
By a frog”

The other man, just as
   lonesome as I am
In this empty universe

The pine woods
   move
In the mist

The poppies! - 
   I could die
In delicacy now

The postman is late
   - The toilet window
Is shining

The purple wee flower
   should be reflected
In that low water

The racket of the starlings
   in the trees -
My cat’s back

The raindrops have plenty
   of personality -
Each one

The rain has filled
   the birdbath
Again, almost

The red paper
   waves for the breeze
- the breeze

The red roof of the barn
   is ravelled
Like familiar meat

There is no deep
   turning-about
In the Void

There’s no Buddha
   because
There’s no me

There’s nothing there
   because
I dont care

The robin on
   the television antenna,
Something on his beak

The rose moves
   like a Reichian disciple
On its stem

These little gray sparrows on the roof
I’ll shot my editor

The sky is still empty,
   the rose is still
On the typewriter keys

The sleeping moth -
   he doesn’t know
The lamps turned up again

The smiling fish -
   where are they,
Scouting bird?

The smoke of old
   naval battles
Is gone

The son packs
   quietly as the
Mother sleeps

The son who wants solitude,
   Enveloped
In his room

The sound of silence
   is all the instruction
You’ll get

The Spring moon -
   How many miles away
Those orange blossoms!

The stars are racing
   real fast
Through the clouds

The storm,
   like Dostoevsky
Builds up as it lists

The strumming of the trees
   reminded me
Of immortal afternoon

The summer chair
   rocking by itself
In the blizzard

The sun keeps getting
   dimmer - foghorns
began to blow in the bay

The Sunny Breeze
   will come to me
Presently

The taste
   of rain -
Why kneel?

The top of Jack
   Mountain – done in
By golden clouds

The train speeding
   thru emptiness
- I was a trainman

The tree looks
   like a dog
Barking at Heaven

The tree moving
   in the moonlight
Wise to me

The trees, already
   bent in the windless
Oklahoma plain

The trees are putting on
   Noh plays - 
Booming, roaring

The vigorous bell-ringing priest
   the catch in the harbor

The white cat
   Is green in the tree shade,
Like Gauguin’s horse

The white chair is
   holding its arms out
to Heaven - dandelions

The whiteness of the houses
   in the moon
Snow everywhere

The windmills of
   Oklahoma look
In every direction

"The wind agrees with me
   not the sun" -
Washlines

The wind sent
   a leaf on
the robin’s back

The word HANDICAPPED
   sliding over snow
On a newspaper

The yellow dolls bow -
   Poor lady
Is dead

This July evening,
   A large frog
On my doorsill

This October evening,
   the velvet eyes
Of Manju[sh]ri

Those birds sitting
   out there on the fence -
They're all going to die.

Three little sparrows
   on the roof
Talking quietly, sadly

Three pencils arranged,
   Three minutes,
Sambaghakaya, Nirvanakaya, Dharmakaya

Thunder and snow -
   how
We shall go!

Thunder in the mountains -
   the iron
Of my mother's love

Thunderstorm over
   - there! The light
is on again

Time keeps running out
   - sweat
On my brow, from playing

To the South,
   in the moonlight,
A sash of cloud

Tonight I'll lower
   my tail -
I've seen them around town

that star
   is waving & flaming
Something awful

Too hot to write 
   haiku – crickets
and mosquitoes

Train on the horizon -
   my window
rattles

Train tunnel, too dark
   for me to write: that
"Men are ignorant"

Trees cant reach
   for a glass
Of water

Trying to study sutras,
   the kitten on my page
Demanding affection

Tuesday - one more
   drop of rain
From my roof

Twilight - the bird
   in the bush
In the rain

Two ants hurry
   to catch up
With lonely Joe

Two cars passing
   on the freeway
- Husband and wife

Two clouds kissing
   backed up to look
At each other

Two Japanese boys
   singing
Inky Dinky Parly Voo

Useless! useless!
   - heavy rain driving 
Into the sea

Velvet horses
   in the valley auction -
Woman sings

Voices of critics
   in the theater lobby -
A moth on the carpet

Walking along the night beach,
   - Military music 
On the boulevard. 

Walking down road with Allen -
   Walking down the road in Autumn.

Walking down the road
   with Allen
- An old dream
   the same dream.

Walking down the road/a crushed snake.
autumn
Red trees -

Walking down the road with dog
   - a crushed leaf

Walking down the road
with dog -
a crushed snake.

Walking down the road with Jack -
a crushed snake

Walking with the dog on the road
   - a crooked leaf.

Walking on the water wasn’t 
   Built in a day

Walking over the water
   my shadow,
Heavier than lead

WARM WIND
   makes the pines
Talk Deep

Wednesday blah
   blah blah -
My mind hurts

Who cares about the pop-off trees
   of Provence?
A road’s a road

Why’d I open my eyes?
   because
I wanted to

Winking over his pipe
   the Buddha lumberman
Nowhere

Work of the quiet
   mountain, this
Torrent of purity

Worm is looking
   at the moon,
Waiting for me

Wash hung out
   by moonlight
- Friday night

Washing my face
   with snow
Beneath the Little Dipper

Waiting for the leaves
   to fall; -
There goes one!

Waiting for the Zipper
   4 PM -
Sun in West clouds, gold

Water in the birdbath
   - a film of ice
On the moon

Waiting with me for
   the end of this ephemeral
Existence – the moon

Water in a hole
   - behold
The soddden skies

Waving goodbye,
   the little girl,
Backing up

Well here I am,
   2 PM - 
What day is it?

Wet fog
   shining
In lamplit leaves

Whatever it is, I quit
   - now I'll let my
breath out –

What could be newer? this
   new little bird
Not yet summer fat!

When the moon sinks
   down to the power line,
I'll go in

What is a rainbow,
   Lord? – a hoop
For the lowly

What is Buddhism?
   - A crazy little
Bird blub

What passes through
   is amusing
Himself being dew

While meditating
   I am Buddha -
Who else?

White clouds of this steamy planet
   obstruct
My vision of the blue void

White rose with red
   splashes – Oh
Vanilla ice cream cherry!

Who wd have guessed
   that a January moon
could be so orange!

Why explain?
   bear burdens
In silence

Wild to sit on a haypile,
   Writing Haikus,
Drinkin wine

Wind too strong
   - empty nest
At midnight

Windows rattling
   in the wind
I’m a lousy lover

Wine at dawn
   - The long
Rainy sleep

Winter – that
   sparrow’s nest
Still empty

Wish I were a rooster
   and leave my sperm
On the sidewalk, shining!

"Woo!" – bird of perfect
   balance on the fir
Just moved his tail

Wooden house
   raw gray -
Pink light in the window

Woke up groaning
   with a dream of a priest
Eating chicken necks

Yard tonight an eerie
   moon leafshroud
A midsummernight’s dream

Yellow halfmoon cradled
   among the horizontal boards
Of my fence

"You and me"
   I sang
Looking at the cemetery

You’d be surprised
   how little I knew
Even up to yesterday

You paid yr homage
   to the moon,
And she sank

Your belly’s too big
   for your
Little teeth

age eighty weak
I shit and offer it to Buddha

all koans just lead you on
but not the delicious pussy of the young girls I go down on

all the bad things I do will go up in smoke
and so will I

all the old masters want is money and fame
strike like a feather but when

alone with the icy moon no passion
these trees this mountain nothing else

amazingly sad how its blade mirrors the years
how sadness extends far as the hills and rivers

and it breaks my heart how so easily
smoke rises tonight like the thought of him

and the nights inside you rocking
smelling the odor of your thighs is everything

and what is the heart
pine breeze voice in a forgotten painting

another house has its own path through the dark
what about when moss grows on the heart’s road

anybody can enter Buddha's world
so few can step into the Devil's

at the bath she bathed scrubbing her face and body
at the bath I splashed water on myself enjoying her body

a beautiful woman's hot vagina's full of love
I've given up trying to put out the fire of my body

before birth after birth
that's where you are now

believe in the man facing you now
just narrow your eyes feel the deep love

beloved Wei-shan wanted to come back as a cow grazing in a wide valley
can't you see him munching flowers idling under stars on a windy night

books koans sitting miss the heart but not fishermen's songs
rain pelts the river I sing beyond all of it

born born everything is always born
thinking about it try not to

break open the cherry tree where's the flower?
but spring

break through one impasse there's another let the sweet
lychee slip over your tongue and down.

brown ruffle of flame rushes across my white paper diploma
why tie up the donkey

brush ink plunge forward blind man who knows each step in the dark
the bristles dry dip again brush blind until you’re gone

a butterfly hovers in front of her face
how long will she sleep

cheap tea thin gruel pale leaves as winter begins
this threadbare robe feels fine in the first dawn frost

chopping up herbs blood flows from my hand into the block
no food my teacher mocks me with a smile

chrysanthemums hammered out of raw iron
that cloud gone now just like my father

clouds endless clouds climbing beyond
ask nothing from words on a page

clouds very high look
not one word helped them get up there

Crazy Cloud likes his own mind its wish for flutesongs rainy nights
drinking muttering beside his women

a crazy lecher shuttling back and forth between whorehouse and bar
this past master paints south north east west with his cock

the crow's caw was ok but one night with a lovely whore
opened a wisdom deeper than what that bird said

cut off everything from everything stand here the soles of your feet the ground
your brain in the black nothing between

don't hesitate get laid that's wisdom
sitting around chanting what crap

don't wait for the man standing in the snow
to cut off his arm help him now

don’t worry please please how many times do I have to say it
there’s no way not to be who you are and where.

eat the wind eat the water nobody can say how
I know a man who stood twenty years on Gojo bridge

the edges of the sword are life and death
no one knows which is which

empty belly no wine it's freezing
melody the angel's shining cloak stains the air

even before trees rocks I was nothing
when I'm dead nowhere I'll be nothing

even if Buddha himself kneeled at my deathbed
he wouldn't be worth shit

even in its scabbard my sword
sees you

even Rinzai's disciples don't know
so many ordinary people know but don't know they know
walking to work talking to themselves

a flower held up twirled between human fingers
a smile barely visible

flowers are silent silence is silent the mind
is a silent flower the silent flower of the world opens

flute notes bring gods demons only that music
again the world's biggest ass-man hasn't one friend
his loneliness that music

for us no difference between reading eating singing
making love not one thing or the other

forget what the masters wrote truth's a razor
each instant sitting here you and I being here

frogs at the bottom of a well like you idiot
thrashing in mud laughable so very very right

fuck flattery success money
all I do is lie back and suck my thumb

the girl listening to the poet bursting with poems thinks nothing
but he thinks he wants her leaning on the gate while she just listens

go down on your silly knees pray
for what? tomorrow is yesterday

gravestones melt to stumps of stone knobs
use them to grind tea leaves

hear the cruel no-answer until blood drips down
beat your head against the wall of it

her mouth played with my cock
the way a cloud plays with the sky

here I am simply trying to get into your head
you think you were born you die what a pity

how is my hand like Mori's?
it's her freedom I love when I'm sick she makes me hard
fingers lips rove everywhere brings my followers joy

Hsu-T'ang tore off his robes like a broken sandal
Zen has no center clouds rake the moon some voice claws at my heart

hundreds of peaks but only one lone bell out of nowhere
maple groves tipped by stars fixed above the inlet

I ask you answer I don't you don't
O Lord Bodidharma what's in your unknown heart

I can't smell a thing can't see their pink
but they'll find branches next spring

I didn't see one thing on my trip
but I breathed and whatever I breathed was time

I don't own a sewing needle but I keep calligraphy
in a special box given by my dying friend

I found my sparrow Sonrin dead one morning
and buried him just as gently as I would my own daughter

I hate it I know it's nothing but I
suck out the world's sweet juicy plum

I have to admit my passion never leaves
fire is the master young grasses appear each spring

I like my anger my grouchy furious love
amazing how we say such nice things about the dead

I live in a shack on the edge of whorehouse row
me autumn a single candle

I love bamboo how it looks
and because men carve it into flutes

I love taking my new girl blind Mori on a spring picnic
I love seeing her exquisite free face its moist sexual heat shine

I remember one quiet afternoon she fished out my cock
bent over played with it in her mouth for at least an hour

I still worry about how I look my dry white hair oh
age wanting to fuck but I'll sing no matter how things are

I think of your death I think of our touching
my head quiet in your lap

I try to be a god man but all that comes
of trying is I feel more guilty

I walked through the door of death came back went back am here
brisk wind warm rain dawn the bleached moon

I was like an old leafless tree until we met green buds burst and blossom
now that I have you I’ll never forget what I owe you

I went half crazy studying sitting for days now the one thing
is fishermen's songs sunset rain clouds the river night after night

I woke from a dream of death to day's amazing
death grass death rice death chairs death death asleep or awake

I won't die I won't go away I'll always be here
no good asking me I won't speak

I'd love to give you something
but what would help?

I'd sniff you like a dog and taste you
then kiss your other mouth endlessly if I could white hair or not

I'm alive! right? don't we say that?
we don't see the bones we walk on

I’m eighty still alive looking up every night
snapping my fingers at time at the promise of love

I’m in it everywhere.
what a miracle trees lakes clouds even dust

I'm like wind pouring down hills into the city
whatever I do is beyond whatever's been done

I'm pure shame
what I do and what I say never the same

I’m up here in the hills starving myself
but I’ll come down for you

I'm whole as long as I hear you singing
then emptiness when you stop

I've burnt all the holy pages I used to carry
but poems flare in my heart

icy window windy snow moon tangled among black flowers
the mind is water wrapping itself where it is around what what what
never the same

if there's nowhere to rest at the end
how can I get lost along the way?

if you don't break rules you're an ass not human
women start us passion comes and goes until death

Ikkyū near death returns your cloak to you
slash it in half and it's still yours

Ikkyū the whole day singing boozing so great so
fully here he built a bridge no one uses 10,000 miles long

Ikkyū this body isn't yours I say to myself
wherever I am I'm there

in a dazzling scabbard
this wooden sword
which can't kill or help you to live

in deep winter I write poems get drunk the cup's heavier heavier moon
whispering all night even at sixty I'm hard in her again and again

in the freezing hall one night in a flimsy robe I hallucinated gold-threaded cloth
it hung in the air uselessly

in war there's no time to teach or learn Zen carry a strong stick
bash your attackers

inside the koan clear mind
gashes the great darkness

it isn't that we're alone or not alone
whose voice do you want mine? yours?

it takes horseshit to grow bamboo
and it too longs forever weeps begs to the wind

it's a hungry morning when I don't see her
more and more I love her and drink wine more

it's logical: if you are not going anywhere
any road is the right one

keep writing those deep questions sleep on
when you wake even you'll be gone

know nothing I know nothing nobody does can you face me
and know nothing know

life's like climbing knife-tree hills with swords sticking up
day and night something stabs you

like a knifeblade the moon will be full then less
than nothing but it`s dawn and the moon`s a knifeblade

Lin-chi screamed KATSU! at precisely the right time gave life death KATSU!
eyes everywhere blazing blazing eyes sun moon KATSU! KATSU!

Lin-chi’s followers don’t know Zen I the Blind Donkey do
my tongue and gentle fingers thick hard cock
one autumn night’s a thousand centuries

listen whose face is it a piece
of sunlit jade warbling laughing

lone moon no clouds
we stumble through the night

long life
the wild pines want it too

look up Heaven look around you Earth red flesh white bones crushed
between both the real you survives

melons eggplants rice rivers the sky
I offer them to you on this holiday

men are like cows horses fuck poetry
look at your hand read it

the mind is exactly this tree that grass
without thought or feeling both disappear

mirror facing mirror
nowhere else

my death? who was it anyway always where he was never
no not once ever seeing himself an eyeball speaks

my dying teacher could not wipe himself unlike you disciples
who use bamboo I cleaned his lovely ass with my bare hands

my friend's funeral this morning
burns inside me like my own death

my gray cat jumped up just as I lifted this spoon
we're born we die

my mind can’t answer when you call
if it did I’d be stealing your life from you

my monk friend has a wierd endearing habit
he weaves sandals and leaves them secretly by the roadside

my name Ikkyū's disgusting not dust yet
it should be swept away and will be

nature's a killer I won't sing to it
I hold my breath and listen to the dead singing under the grass

night after night after night stay up all night
nothing but your own night

night plum blossoms spreading under a branch
between her thighs narcissus revolves smell it?

no masters only you the master is you
wonderful no?

no money in a dream plums simple and close
five thousand coins in a row in a dream of power

no more Zen write one great line
like a needle piercing a sore spot on your arm

no nothing only those wintry crows
bright black in the sun

no tiny wooden hut with a grass roof in the hills
but this city these people where I live still are impossible

no walls no roof no anything my house
doesn't get wet doesn't get blown down

no words sitting alone night in my hut eyes closed hands open
wisps of an unknown face

nobody before me nobody after
writing it

nobody cares about my hungers thirsts
smash the plum blossom's one night's ice

nobody knows I'm a storm I'm
dawn on the mountain twilight on the town

nobody knows shit nobody lives anywhere
hello dust!

nobody told the flowers to come up nobody
will ask them to leave when spring’s gone

nobody understands my no Zen Zen
not even that crow's shattering bleak scream got it

nobody understands why we do what we do
this cup of sake does

not two not one either
and the unpainted breeze in the ink painting feels cool

October wind crosses the world
in this field moist grass bends to itself and to the sea

oh green green willow wonderfully red flower
but I know the colors are not there

oh the evening wind hurries smoke our smoke
into the sky

oh yes things exist like the echo when you yell at the foot of a
huge mountain

on the deep green lily pad dew
has no color of its own

once while she was cooking I kneeled put my head between her warm dark legs
up her skirt kissed and licked and sucked her until she came

one half-thawed lovesong chilly as dusk remains
my life stalking hills now these shameful purple robes

one long pure beautiful road of pain
and the beauty of death and no pain

one of you saved my satori paper I know it piece by piece you
pasted it back together now watch me burn it once and for all

one pause between each crow's
reckless shriek Ikkyū Ikkyū Ikkyū

one white blossom snow
razor-edged mountains slice my belly

one wisp rootless shifting a dot in the blue sky
know it

only a kind deadly sincere man
can show you the way here in the other world

only one koan matters
you

outrageous eyes ears nose in the cold one silent tinkling bell
clear beautiful nudged by the wind hangs over the polished railing

passion's red thread is infinite
like the earth always under me

peace isn't luck for six years stand facing a silent wall
until the you of your face melts like a candle

pine needles inches deep hug the ground
no one lives here

pleasure pain are equal in a clear heart
no mountain hides the moon

plum blossom close to the ground her dark place opens
wet with the dew of her passion wet with the lust of my tongue

poems should come from bare ground
night falling on night falling on a black landscape

poetry's hellish bullshit one good way to suffer men love it
men stupid as horses cows

poetry's ridiculous write it feel proud
strut look in the mirror believe you know

raging in the now hungry for it
crows rattle the air no dust

rain drips from the roof lip
loneliness sounds like that

rain hail snow ice
I love watching the river

raining or not
walk lifting your heavy wet sleeves

rice boils in my broken-footed iron pot
it’s everything but you can’t taste it

Rinzai did it without a care
no clouds wind sky a heart that simply sings

self other right wrong wasting your life arguing
you're happy really you are happy

sexual love's attachment pain is deeper that I can know
wind soothes my thoughts this lust my ceaseless koan
impossibly happy

she’d play with it almost anywhere day and night
touch it with the deepest part of herself

sick all I can think of is love and fucking the love song
hums in my groin listen my hair’s white wild grasses uncut on my meadow

sick of it whatever it's called sick of the names
I dedicate every pore to what's here

sick Zen from the famous three you know who I mean
I can change your life with a mere look

sin like a madman until you can't do anything else
no room for any more

six years of hunger sitting like a secret in darkness
his bones pierced with the less-and-less the near-nothing

skinny legs wandering no friends the lamppost moves not me following
my song money is power spring the cuckoo weeps blood inside me

so burning’s knowing and I’m not even drunk on three wines
plunge into the fire reality pure endless pain

so many paths go up from the foothills
but one moon grazes the peak

so many words about it
the only language is you don't open your lips

some die meditating some on their feet but he did both
not black not white that old man P’u-K’o
like a distant bird barely audible

some monks live in caves build huts on snowy mountains
right now clouds flee across the moon my heart

something in us always wants to cry out
someone we love knows hears

sometimes all I am is dark emptiness
I can't hide in the sleeves of my own robes

stand tiptoe on the tip of a needle
like a grain of sand flashing in sunlight

stare at it until your eyes drop out
this desk this wall this unreal page

stirring cold ashes with his eyes shut tight
another student weeps into the sparks

suddenly nothing but grief
so I put on my father's old ripped raincoat

sutras poems I stash them under my robe burn them all
but not words written on my heart

talk about family laws ideals my silence drives me mad
without passion and ignorance none of it works

ten dumb years I wanted things to be different furious proud I still feel it
one summer midnight in my little boat on Lake Biwa caaaawwweeeee
father when I was a boy you left us now I forgive you

ten fussy days running this temple all red tape
look me up if you want to in the bar whorehouse fish market

ten years of whorehouse joy I'm alone now in the mountains
the pines are like a jail the wind scratches my skin

that stone Buddha deserves all the birdshit it gets
I wave my skinny arms like a tall flower in the wind

they could have put a small doll in the urn
but it was my father's ashes
know nothing I know nothing nobody does can you face me and know nothing know

they do it in the street in broad daylight like cows and horses
it’s late the moon goes under west of Ch’ang-an

they screw inside the temple call in students for “mysterious satori”
only I teach like the seasons

they used sticks and yells and other tricks those fakes
Ikkyū reaches high low like sunlight

thirsty you dream of water cold you want fire
not me I want the firm warm breasts and wetness of a woman

this boat is and is not
When it sinks both disappear

this brick house I live in is really the sky
and just as priceless

this cow has come to teach you: what you do is where you are
where you are is what you do: nobody knows which monk I was

this donkey stumbles blind over stones into walls, ditches
no words for grief or joy no words for his ruined heart

this hungry monk chanting by lamplight is Buddha
and he still thinks of you

this ink painting of wind blowing through pines
who hears it?

this morning's koan's a poem tonight people flock to this mountain
I live the problem ignore poor birds pleading for food

this soul torch I hold up lights the sky
think of those nights freezing staring into the river

this useless dying koan body singing its lust
weeds not yet cleared everywhere

this world this thing you and I call knowing
those ten words these fifty-four-year-old fingers are everything

those old koans meaningless just ways of faking virtue
this gorgeous young whore wears silk robes that hang open about an inch

three-foot axe leans on the headsman's block
cuts through deep feelings April

up all night in this fisherman’s hut drinking talking
his wife hates me bangs her spoon on the kettle

watching my four-year-old daughter dance
I can't break free of her

we live in a cage of light an incredible cage
animals animals without end

we're lost born in delusions deeper than any mind
if you could escape awakening you'd ripen like a pear all by itself

we're lost where the mind can't find us
utterly lost

a well nobody dug filled with no water
ripples and a shapeless weightless man drinks

when I was forty-seven everybody came to see me
so I walked out forever

where you are whatever you do
hearing a stalk struck remember bamboo remembers nothing

white-haired priest in his eighties
Ikkyū still sings aloud each night to himself to the sky to the clouds
because she gave herself freely
her hands her mouth her breasts her long moist thighs

who brought these fish sizzling in the pan I’ll never stop thinking
about women white hair lust sings through my body weeds everywhere

who teaches truth? good/ bad the wrong way
Crazy Cloud knows the taste of his own shit
long love letters brief passionate poems

why is it all so beautiful this fake dream
this craziness why?

wife daughters friends this is for you satori
is mistake after mistake

the wise know nothing at all
well maybe one song

a woman is enlightenment when you're with her and the red thread
of both your passions flare inside you and you see

Yōsō hangs up ladles baskets useless donations in the temple
my style’s a straw raincoat strolls by rivers and lakes

you can hear it when it doesn't even move
you can hear it when the wind forces itself past rocks

you can't be anyone but you
therefore you are that Other one you love

you can't make cherry blossoms by tearing off petals
to plant only spring does that

you me when I think really think about it
are the same

you poor sad thing thinking death is real
all by itself

you stand inside me naked infinite love
the dawn bell rips my dreaming heart

you won't even be here to read them
what stupidity to put these words into your mouth

your name Mori means forest like the infinite fresh
green distances of your blindness

Zen's finished stick your brain in a peach branch guzzle sake
sing until you have no throat then words come by themselves
