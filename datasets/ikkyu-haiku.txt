you poor sad thing thinking death is real / all by itself
<|endoftext|>
inside the koan clear mind / gashes the great darkness
<|endoftext|>
nobody knows I'm a storm I'm / dawn on the mountain twilight on the town
<|endoftext|>
we live in a cage of light an incredible cage / animals animals without end
<|endoftext|>
born born everything is always born / thinking about it try not to
<|endoftext|>
nature's a killer I won't sing to it / I hold my breath and listen to the dead singing under the grass
<|endoftext|>
six years of hunger sitting like a secret in darkness / his bones pierced with the less-and-less the near-nothing
<|endoftext|>
you can hear it when it doesn't even move / you can hear it when the wind forces itself past rocks
<|endoftext|>
another house has its own path through the dark / what about when moss grows on the heart’s road
<|endoftext|>
and it breaks my heart how so easily / smoke rises tonight like the thought of him
<|endoftext|>
this person near death returns your cloak to you / slash it in half and it's still yours
<|endoftext|>
ten years of whorehouse joy I'm alone now in the mountains / the pines are like a jail the wind scratches my skin
<|endoftext|>
Rinzai did it without a care / no clouds wind sky a heart that simply sings
<|endoftext|>
oh the evening wind hurries smoke our smoke / into the sky
<|endoftext|>
on the deep green lily pad dew / has no color of its own
<|endoftext|>
rice boils in my broken-footed iron pot / it’s everything but you can’t taste it
<|endoftext|>
I found my sparrow Sonrin dead one morning / and buried him just as gently as I would my own daughter
<|endoftext|>
I ask you answer I don't you don't / O Lord Bodidharma what's in your unknown heart
<|endoftext|>
know nothing I know nothing nobody does can you face me / and know nothing know
<|endoftext|>
sin like a madman until you can't do anything else / no room for any more
<|endoftext|>
stand tiptoe on the tip of a needle / like a grain of sand flashing in sunlight
<|endoftext|>
who teaches truth? good/ bad the wrong way / Crazy Cloud knows the taste of his own shit / long love letters brief passionate poems
<|endoftext|>
even before trees rocks I was nothing / when I'm dead nowhere I'll be nothing
<|endoftext|>
this brick house I live in is really the sky / and just as priceless
<|endoftext|>
I hate it I know it's nothing but I / suck out the world's sweet juicy plum
<|endoftext|>
the wise know nothing at all / well maybe one song
<|endoftext|>
listen whose face is it a piece / of sunlit jade warbling laughing
<|endoftext|>
white-haired priest in his eighties / this person still sings aloud each night to himself to the sky to the clouds / because she gave herself freely / her hands her mouth her breasts her long moist thighs
<|endoftext|>
I'm whole as long as I hear you singing / then emptiness when you stop
<|endoftext|>
brown ruffle of flame rushes across my white paper diploma / why tie up the donkey
<|endoftext|>
all the old masters want is money and fame / strike like a feather but when
<|endoftext|>
a woman is enlightenment when you're with her and the red thread / of both your passions flare inside you and you see
<|endoftext|>
ten fussy days running this temple all red tape / look me up if you want to in the bar whorehouse fish market
<|endoftext|>
poetry's ridiculous write it feel proud / strut look in the mirror believe you know
<|endoftext|>
so many paths go up from the foothills / but one moon grazes the peak
<|endoftext|>
needy texts / empty sex.
<|endoftext|>
men are like cows horses fuck poetry / look at your hand read it
<|endoftext|>
one white blossom snow / razor-edged mountains slice my belly
<|endoftext|>
one pause between each crow's / reckless shriek this person this person this person
<|endoftext|>
once while she was cooking I kneeled put my head between her warm dark legs / up her skirt kissed and licked and sucked her until she came
<|endoftext|>
where you are whatever you do / hearing a stalk struck remember bamboo remembers nothing
<|endoftext|>
look up Heaven look around you Earth red flesh white bones crushed / between both the real you survives
<|endoftext|>
I woke from a dream of death to day's amazing / death grass death rice death chairs death death asleep or awake
<|endoftext|>
sutras poems I stash them under my robe burn them all / but not words written on my heart
<|endoftext|>
in war there's no time to teach or learn Zen carry a strong stick / bash your attackers
<|endoftext|>
ten dumb years I wanted things to be different furious proud I still feel it / one summer midnight in my little boat on Lake Biwa caaaawwweeeee / father when I was a boy you left us now I forgive you
<|endoftext|>
rain hail snow ice / I love watching the river
<|endoftext|>
beloved Wei-shan wanted to come back as a cow grazing in a wide valley / can't you see him munching flowers idling under stars on a windy night
<|endoftext|>
my mind can’t answer when you call / if it did I’d be stealing your life from you
<|endoftext|>
gravestones melt to stumps of stone knobs / use them to grind tea leaves
<|endoftext|>
when I was forty-seven everybody came to see me / so I walked out forever
<|endoftext|>
I'm like wind pouring down hills into the city / whatever I do is beyond whatever's been done
<|endoftext|>
pleasure pain are equal in a clear heart / no mountain hides the moon
<|endoftext|>
Zen's finished stick your brain in a peach branch guzzle sake / sing until you have no throat then words come by themselves
<|endoftext|>
chopping up herbs blood flows from my hand into the block / no food my teacher mocks me with a smile
<|endoftext|>
outrageous eyes ears nose in the cold one silent tinkling bell / clear beautiful nudged by the wind hangs over the polished railing
<|endoftext|>
those old koans meaningless just ways of faking virtue / this gorgeous young whore wears silk robes that hang open about an inch
<|endoftext|>
so many words about it / the only language is you don't open your lips
<|endoftext|>
suddenly nothing but grief / so I put on my father's old ripped raincoat
<|endoftext|>
so burning’s knowing and I’m not even drunk on three wines / plunge into the fire reality pure endless pain
<|endoftext|>
flute notes bring gods demons only that music / again the world's biggest ass-man hasn't one friend / his loneliness that music
<|endoftext|>
sick all I can think of is love and fucking the love song / hums in my groin listen my hair’s white wild grasses uncut on my meadow
<|endoftext|>
peace isn't luck for six years stand facing a silent wall / until the you of your face melts like a candle
<|endoftext|>
Yōsō hangs up ladles baskets useless donations in the temple / my style’s a straw raincoat strolls by rivers and lakes
<|endoftext|>
and what is the heart / pine breeze voice in a forgotten painting
<|endoftext|>
October wind crosses the world / in this field moist grass bends to itself and to the sea
<|endoftext|>
my death? who was it anyway always where he was never / no not once ever seeing himself an eyeball speaks
<|endoftext|>
here I am simply trying to get into your head / you think you were born you die what a pity
<|endoftext|>
empty belly no wine it's freezing / melody the angel's shining cloak stains the air
<|endoftext|>
fuck flattery success money / all I do is lie back and suck my thumb
<|endoftext|>
Crazy Cloud likes his own mind its wish for flutesongs rainy nights / drinking muttering beside his women
<|endoftext|>
Hsu-T'ang tore off his robes like a broken sandal / Zen has no center clouds rake the moon some voice claws at my heart
<|endoftext|>
no words sitting alone night in my hut eyes closed hands open / wisps of an unknown face
<|endoftext|>
one wisp rootless shifting a dot in the blue sky / know it
<|endoftext|>
my dying teacher could not wipe himself unlike you disciples / who use bamboo I cleaned his lovely ass with my bare hands
<|endoftext|>
I didn't see one thing on my trip / but I breathed and whatever I breathed was time
<|endoftext|>
Lin-chi’s followers don’t know Zen I the Blind Donkey do / my tongue and gentle fingers thick hard cock / one autumn night’s a thousand centuries
<|endoftext|>
watching my four-year-old daughter dance / I can't break free of her
<|endoftext|>
don't wait for the man standing in the snow / to cut off his arm help him now
<|endoftext|>
clouds very high look / not one word helped them get up there
<|endoftext|>
passion's red thread is infinite / like the earth always under me
<|endoftext|>
they do it in the street in broad daylight like cows and horses / it’s late the moon goes under west of Ch’ang-an
<|endoftext|>
if there's nowhere to rest at the end / how can I get lost along the way?
<|endoftext|>
I like my anger my grouchy furious love / amazing how we say such nice things about the dead
<|endoftext|>
only one koan matters / you
<|endoftext|>
raining or not / walk lifting your heavy wet sleeves
<|endoftext|>
nobody cares about my hungers thirsts / smash the plum blossom's one night's ice
<|endoftext|>
it isn't that we're alone or not alone / whose voice do you want mine? yours?
<|endoftext|>
frogs at the bottom of a well like you idiot / thrashing in mud laughable so very very right
<|endoftext|>
even in its scabbard my sword / sees you
<|endoftext|>
your name Mori means forest like the infinite fresh / green distances of your blindness
<|endoftext|>
books koans sitting miss the heart but not fishermen's songs / rain pelts the river I sing beyond all of it
<|endoftext|>
one half-thawed lovesong chilly as dusk remains / my life stalking hills now these shameful purple robes
<|endoftext|>
plum blossom close to the ground her dark place opens / wet with the dew of her passion wet with the lust of my tongue
<|endoftext|>
alone with the icy moon no passion / these trees this mountain nothing else
<|endoftext|>
a crazy lecher shuttling back and forth between whorehouse and bar / this past master paints south north east west with his cock
<|endoftext|>
we're lost where the mind can't find us / utterly lost
<|endoftext|>
how is my hand like Mori's? / it's her freedom I love when I'm sick she makes me hard / fingers lips rove everywhere brings my followers joy
<|endoftext|>
this hungry monk chanting by lamplight is Buddha / and he still thinks of you
<|endoftext|>
I love taking my new girl blind Mori on a spring picnic / I love seeing her exquisite free face its moist sexual heat shine
<|endoftext|>
skinny legs wandering no friends the lamppost moves not me following / my song money is power spring the cuckoo weeps blood inside me
<|endoftext|>
even Rinzai's disciples don't know / so many ordinary people know but don't know they know / walking to work talking to themselves
<|endoftext|>
melons eggplants rice rivers the sky / I offer them to you on this holiday
<|endoftext|>
age eighty weak / I shit and offer it to Buddha
<|endoftext|>
cut off everything from everything stand here the soles of your feet the ground / your brain in the black nothing between
<|endoftext|>
clouds endless clouds climbing beyond / ask nothing from words on a page
<|endoftext|>
the mind is exactly this tree that grass / without thought or feeling both disappear
<|endoftext|>
before birth after birth / that's where you are now
<|endoftext|>
wife daughters friends this is for you satori / is mistake after mistake
<|endoftext|>
you can't make cherry blossoms by tearing off petals / to plant only spring does that
<|endoftext|>
sick Zen from the famous three you know who I mean / I can change your life with a mere look
<|endoftext|>
this boat is and is not / When it sinks both disappear
<|endoftext|>
they used sticks and yells and other tricks those fakes / this person reaches high low like sunlight
<|endoftext|>
I think of your death I think of our touching / my head quiet in your lap
<|endoftext|>
oh green green willow wonderfully red flower / but I know the colors are not there
<|endoftext|>
nobody knows shit nobody lives anywhere / hello dust!
<|endoftext|>
flowers are silent silence is silent the mind / is a silent flower the silent flower of the world opens
<|endoftext|>
some die meditating some on their feet but he did both / not black not white that old man P’u-K’o / like a distant bird barely audible
<|endoftext|>
some monks live in caves build huts on snowy mountains / right now clouds flee across the moon my heart
<|endoftext|>
you won't even be here to read them / what stupidity to put these words into your mouth
<|endoftext|>
this ink painting of wind blowing through pines / who hears it?
<|endoftext|>
a well nobody dug filled with no water / ripples and a shapeless weightless man drinks
<|endoftext|>
night plum blossoms spreading under a branch / between her thighs narcissus revolves smell it?
<|endoftext|>
a beautiful woman's hot vagina's full of love / I've given up trying to put out the fire of my body
<|endoftext|>
up all night in this fisherman’s hut drinking talking / his wife hates me bangs her spoon on the kettle
<|endoftext|>
hear the cruel no-answer until blood drips down / beat your head against the wall of it
<|endoftext|>
talk about family laws ideals my silence drives me mad / without passion and ignorance none of it works
<|endoftext|>
I won't die I won't go away I'll always be here / no good asking me I won't speak
<|endoftext|>
don’t worry please please how many times do I have to say it / there’s no way not to be who you are and where.
<|endoftext|>
mirror facing mirror / nowhere else
<|endoftext|>
this useless dying koan body singing its lust / weeds not yet cleared everywhere
<|endoftext|>
icy window windy snow moon tangled among black flowers / the mind is water wrapping itself where it is around what what what / never the same
<|endoftext|>
sexual love's attachment pain is deeper that I can know / wind soothes my thoughts this lust my ceaseless koan / impossibly happy
<|endoftext|>
lone moon no clouds / we stumble through the night
<|endoftext|>
a butterfly hovers in front of her face / how long will she sleep
<|endoftext|>
rain drips from the roof lip / loneliness sounds like that
<|endoftext|>
you stand inside me naked infinite love / the dawn bell rips my dreaming heart
<|endoftext|>
this cow has come to teach you: what you do is where you are / where you are is what you do: nobody knows which monk I was
<|endoftext|>
forget what the masters wrote truth's a razor / each instant sitting here you and I being here
<|endoftext|>
this person this body isn't yours I say to myself / wherever I am I'm there
<|endoftext|>
go down on your silly knees pray / for what? tomorrow is yesterday
<|endoftext|>
all poems just lead you on / but not the delicious pussy of the young girls I go down on
<|endoftext|>
chrysanthemums hammered out of raw iron / that cloud gone now just like my father
<|endoftext|>
nobody told the flowers to come up nobody / will ask them to leave when spring’s gone
<|endoftext|>
I have to admit my passion never leaves / fire is the master young grasses appear each spring
<|endoftext|>
they screw inside the temple call in students for “mysterious satori” / only I teach like the seasons
<|endoftext|>
long life / the wild pines want it too
<|endoftext|>
thirsty you dream of water cold you want fire / not me I want the firm warm breasts and wetness of a woman
<|endoftext|>
a flower held up twirled between human fingers / a smile barely visible
<|endoftext|>
oh yes things exist like the echo when you yell at the foot of a / huge mountain
<|endoftext|>
the girl listening to the poet bursting with poems thinks nothing / but he thinks he wants her leaning on the gate while she just listens
<|endoftext|>
I'd sniff you like a dog and taste you / then kiss your other mouth endlessly if I could white hair or not
<|endoftext|>
not two not one either / and the unpainted breeze in the ink painting feels cool
<|endoftext|>
that stone Buddha deserves all the birdshit it gets / I wave my skinny arms like a tall flower in the wind
<|endoftext|>
break open the cherry tree where's the flower? / but spring
<|endoftext|>
in a dazzling scabbard / this wooden sword / which can't kill or help you to live
<|endoftext|>
in deep winter I write poems get drunk the cup's heavier heavier moon / whispering all night even at sixty I'm hard in her again and again
<|endoftext|>
anybody can enter Buddha's world / so few can step into the Devil's
<|endoftext|>
this person the whole day singing boozing so great so / fully here he built a bridge no one uses 10,000 miles long
<|endoftext|>
stare at it until your eyes drop out / this desk this wall this unreal page
<|endoftext|>
and the nights inside you rocking / smelling the odor of your thighs is everything
<|endoftext|>
I try to be a god man but all that comes / of trying is I feel more guilty
<|endoftext|>
like a knifeblade the moon will be full then less / than nothing but it`s dawn and the moon`s a knifeblade
<|endoftext|>
keep writing those deep questions sleep on / when you wake even you'll be gone
<|endoftext|>
nobody understands why we do what we do / this cup of sake does
<|endoftext|>
I'm alive! right? don't we say that? / we don't see the bones we walk on
<|endoftext|>
I still worry about how I look my dry white hair oh / age wanting to fuck but I'll sing no matter how things are
<|endoftext|>
I'm pure shame / what I do and what I say never the same
<|endoftext|>
don't hesitate get laid that's wisdom / sitting around chanting what crap
<|endoftext|>
no tiny wooden hut with a grass roof in the hills / but this city these people where I live still are impossible
<|endoftext|>
I've burnt all the holy pages I used to carry / but poems flare in my heart
<|endoftext|>
no money in a dream plums simple and close / five thousand coins in a row in a dream of power
<|endoftext|>
break through one impasse there's another let the sweet / lychee slip over your tongue and down.
<|endoftext|>
three-foot axe leans on the headsman's block / cuts through deep feelings April
<|endoftext|>
I live in a shack on the edge of whorehouse row / me autumn a single candle
<|endoftext|>
only a kind deadly sincere man / can show you the way here in the other world
<|endoftext|>
I remember one quiet afternoon she fished out my cock / bent over played with it in her mouth for at least an hour
<|endoftext|>
no walls no roof no anything my house / doesn't get wet doesn't get blown down
<|endoftext|>
one of you saved my satori paper I know it piece by piece you / pasted it back together now watch me burn it once and for all
<|endoftext|>
I walked through the door of death came back went back am here / brisk wind warm rain dawn the bleached moon
<|endoftext|>
you me when I think really think about it / are the same
<|endoftext|>
my name this person's disgusting not dust yet / it should be swept away and will be
<|endoftext|>
I’m eighty still alive looking up every night / snapping my fingers at time at the promise of love
<|endoftext|>
why is it all so beautiful this fake dream / this craziness why?
<|endoftext|>
I’m in it everywhere. / what a miracle trees lakes clouds even dust
<|endoftext|>
she’d play with it almost anywhere day and night / touch it with the deepest part of herself
<|endoftext|>
even if Buddha himself kneeled at my deathbed / he wouldn't be worth shit
<|endoftext|>
this morning's koan's a poem tonight people flock to this mountain / I live the problem ignore poor birds pleading for food
<|endoftext|>
if you don't break rules you're an ass not human / women start us passion comes and goes until death
<|endoftext|>
who brought these fish sizzling in the pan I’ll never stop thinking / about women white hair lust sings through my body weeds everywhere
<|endoftext|>
no masters only you the master is you / wonderful no?
<|endoftext|>
this donkey stumbles blind over stones into walls, ditches / no words for grief or joy no words for his ruined heart
<|endoftext|>
my monk friend has a wierd endearing habit / he weaves sandals and leaves them secretly by the roadside
<|endoftext|>
in the freezing hall one night in a flimsy robe I hallucinated gold-threaded cloth / it hung in the air uselessly
<|endoftext|>
no nothing only those wintry crows / bright black in the sun
<|endoftext|>
I’m up here in the hills starving myself / but I’ll come down for you
<|endoftext|>
I don't own a sewing needle but I keep calligraphy / in a special box given by my dying friend
<|endoftext|>
something in us always wants to cry out / someone we love knows hears
<|endoftext|>
nobody before me nobody after / writing it
<|endoftext|>
the edges of the sword are life and death / no one knows which is which
<|endoftext|>
hundreds of peaks but only one lone bell out of nowhere / maple groves tipped by stars fixed above the inlet
<|endoftext|>
they could have put a small doll in the urn / but it was my father's ashes / know nothing I know nothing nobody does can you face me and know nothing know
<|endoftext|>
brush ink plunge forward blind man who knows each step in the dark / the bristles dry dip again brush blind until you’re gone
<|endoftext|>
it's logical: if you are not going anywhere / any road is the right one
<|endoftext|>
life's like climbing knife-tree hills with swords sticking up / day and night something stabs you
<|endoftext|>
one long pure beautiful road of pain / and the beauty of death and no pain
<|endoftext|>
I love bamboo how it looks / and because men carve it into flutes
<|endoftext|>
at the bath she bathed scrubbing her face and body / at the bath I splashed water on myself enjoying her body
<|endoftext|>
I went half crazy studying sitting for days now the one thing / is fishermen's songs sunset rain clouds the river night after night
<|endoftext|>
sometimes all I am is dark emptiness / I can't hide in the sleeves of my own robes
<|endoftext|>
raging in the now hungry for it / crows rattle the air no dust
<|endoftext|>
eat the wind eat the water nobody can say how / I know a man who stood twenty years on Gojo bridge
<|endoftext|>
I can't smell a thing can't see their pink / but they'll find branches next spring
<|endoftext|>
my gray cat jumped up just as I lifted this spoon / we're born we die
<|endoftext|>
Lin-chi screamed KATSU! at precisely the right time gave life death KATSU! / eyes everywhere blazing blazing eyes sun moon KATSU! KATSU!
<|endoftext|>
believe in the man facing you now / just narrow your eyes feel the deep love
<|endoftext|>
amazingly sad how its blade mirrors the years / how sadness extends far as the hills and rivers
<|endoftext|>
self other right wrong wasting your life arguing / you're happy really you are happy
<|endoftext|>
I was like an old leafless tree until we met green buds burst and blossom / now that I have you I’ll never forget what I owe you
<|endoftext|>
sick of it whatever it's called sick of the names / I dedicate every pore to what's here
<|endoftext|>
night after night after night stay up all night / nothing but your own night
<|endoftext|>
no more Zen write one great line / like a needle piercing a sore spot on your arm
<|endoftext|>
poems should come from bare ground / night falling on night falling on a black landscape
<|endoftext|>
all the bad things I do will go up in smoke / and so will I
<|endoftext|>
for us no difference between reading eating singing / making love not one thing or the other
<|endoftext|>
it's a hungry morning when I don't see her / more and more I love her and drink wine more
<|endoftext|>
we're lost born in delusions deeper than any mind / if you could escape awakening you'd ripen like a pear all by itself
<|endoftext|>
poetry's hellish bullshit one good way to suffer men love it / men stupid as horses cows
<|endoftext|>
cheap tea thin gruel pale leaves as winter begins / this threadbare robe feels fine in the first dawn frost
<|endoftext|>
my friend's funeral this morning / burns inside me like my own death
<|endoftext|>
this soul torch I hold up lights the sky / think of those nights freezing staring into the river
<|endoftext|>
pine needles inches deep hug the ground / no one lives here
<|endoftext|>
the crow's caw was ok but one night with a lovely whore / opened a wisdom deeper than what that bird said
<|endoftext|>
it takes horseshit to grow bamboo / and it too longs forever weeps begs to the wind
<|endoftext|>
I'd love to give you something / but what would help?
<|endoftext|>
this world this thing you and I call knowing / those ten words these fifty-four-year-old fingers are everything
<|endoftext|>
you can't be anyone but you / therefore you are that Other one you love
<|endoftext|>
stirring cold ashes with his eyes shut tight / another student weeps into the sparks
<|endoftext|>
her mouth played with my cock / the way a cloud plays with the sky
<|endoftext|>
nobody understands my no Zen Zen / not even that crow's shattering bleak scream got it
