You hugged that tree closer than any lover / a tangle of limbs and dripping sweat  / rough hands grasping at the hard knots and taut sinews / of twisting bodies.
<|endoftext|>
There's a long silence in the car until Johnny interrupts  / "What's the point of fucking roses?" / "They're expensive. They just die."
<|endoftext|>
And it comes back and through and over you, the feeling of despair. / I try to plead with you and breathe for you but gasp I do for air
<|endoftext|>
They'll go out to the bars  / They'll have drinks  / and jovial times.
<|endoftext|>
and the nights inside you rocking / smelling the odor of your thighs is everything
<|endoftext|>
Grain Elevators are tall trucks / that let the road / approach them
<|endoftext|>
I remembered my father's words as I put on my sweater / He said "Son, sometimes life doesn't get any better" / Now it's time, once again, to get it all back in order / Even though heartbreak is waiting just around the corner
<|endoftext|>
Buds in the snow / the deadly fight / between two birds
<|endoftext|>
Sir i am at sea  / Flotsam upon this world  / Blessed by the bounty of waves  / yet directionless i do stay  / I am at sea sir.
<|endoftext|>
this person the whole day singing boozing so great so / fully here he built a bridge no one uses 10,000 miles long
<|endoftext|>
my best friend yelled at me today / for doing drugs / stop that shit, he said / he typed it in all caps
<|endoftext|>
And not a day goes by that I don't wish / She was still my friend.
<|endoftext|>
Late moon rising / Frost / On the grass
<|endoftext|>
nobody understands why we do what we do / this cup of sake does
<|endoftext|>
Great again like the good ol’ days / Of white picket fences, made in the U.S.A. / And white picket neighbours who were as well. / Great like nuclear families / With Nuclear dreams
<|endoftext|>
All I see is what / I see / Red fire sunset
<|endoftext|>
My rose arbor knows more / about June / Than it'll know about winter
<|endoftext|>
After supper / on crossed paws, / The cat meditates
<|endoftext|>
Coming from the West, / covering the moon, / Clouds – not a sound
<|endoftext|>
Autumn nite / my mother cuts her throat
<|endoftext|>
In the middle of / the corn, a new / Car slithering
<|endoftext|>
We're all in love / with The Coffeeshop Girl.
<|endoftext|>
The earth winked / at me right / In the john
<|endoftext|>
A black bull / and a white bird / Standing together on the shore
<|endoftext|>
The castle of the Gandharvas / is full of aging / Young couples
<|endoftext|>
I was twenty years old / When I loved you / My stomach sank / The room was cold / I couldn't die / We're supposed to grow old / You stayed strong
<|endoftext|>
Old man of Aix / white hair, beret / Gone up the Cezanne street
<|endoftext|>
Everywhere beyond / the Truth, / Empty space blue
<|endoftext|>
lone moon no clouds / we stumble through the night
<|endoftext|>
look up Heaven look around you Earth red flesh white bones crushed / between both the real you survives
<|endoftext|>
Birds singing / in the dark / In the rainy dawn
<|endoftext|>
I beg the sky and moon and trees that soon my death may swiftly come
<|endoftext|>
My health is deteriorating and there’s nothing the doctors can do. / Hello.
<|endoftext|>
i am standing in my room with the lights off holding an empty glass of water in one hand / my brain is saying, 'you will live and die alone'
<|endoftext|>
And I don't ever want to wake up.
<|endoftext|>
Why’d I open my eyes? / because / I wanted to
<|endoftext|>
The top of Jack / Mountain – done in / By golden clouds
<|endoftext|>
My blue spruce / in the pale / Haze dusk
<|endoftext|>
Blasphemy-free beaming box / Of blissful hope / And life-changing appliances. / Great like late-night shows / And Rebels without a Cause
<|endoftext|>
Autumn night / Salvation Army sign / On a cold brick building
<|endoftext|>
Came down from my / ivory tower / And found no world
<|endoftext|>
The book / stands all by itself / on the shelf
<|endoftext|>
Nat Wills, a tramp / America / In 1905
<|endoftext|>
Straining at the padlock, / the garage doors / At noon
<|endoftext|>
"Just make sure he's in a better place now because I don't want that red line across his neck to be for nothing" / And, I've made that call before / But I got sent to voice mail
<|endoftext|>
i am opening my eyes / i am smiling  / the grille of the truck is smiling back / things could have been worse
<|endoftext|>
Walking down the road with Jack / a crushed snake
<|endoftext|>
Just want to talk to someone. / Should I tell my best friend that I am having suicidal thoughts?  / Friends don't exist.
<|endoftext|>
I would fill the silence with a fan blowing sweet static into my ear until I slumbered. / It was perfect. / Then you ruined it  / That night I slept wrapped around you  / I didn't need blankets  / Your slow, regular breaths were warm enough.
<|endoftext|>
The birds start singing / but he is in the cat meadows
<|endoftext|>
Replay the tapes / Sponsored by NannyCam / Caught up in some / Jared Fogel scam. / Residue still on my hands / More than enough for a conviction.
<|endoftext|>
White rose with red / splashes – Oh / Vanilla ice cream cherry!
<|endoftext|>
Teetering on the brink / I crawl on all fours / Down the endless hallway / Closing any open doors
<|endoftext|>
cut off everything from everything stand here the soles of your feet the ground / your brain in the black nothing between
<|endoftext|>
These little gray sparrows on the roof / I’ll shot my editor
<|endoftext|>
with my keys in the ignition / idle at the red light / I ask myself / where are my keys / I pull up google maps
<|endoftext|>
I'm the friend that walks behind when the sidewalk won't fit three / I'm the burnt out light house bulb that keeps the sailor out at sea / The things I do to feel alive just end up hurting me / And my mind's the only place in which only I can be
<|endoftext|>
Desolation, Desolation, / so hard / To come down off of
<|endoftext|>
Asking Albert Saijo / for a haiku, / He said nothing
<|endoftext|>
"You and me" / I sang / Looking at the cemetery
<|endoftext|>
"You look at them once, go 'Oh, that's nice'" / "And then you throw it in the trash." / He laughs.
<|endoftext|>
in that vacuum of senses  / she broke her voice, severe as burning books -
<|endoftext|>
Stevenson’s cocaine / for pure MDMA
<|endoftext|>
Expression of self-- / as rewarding as it is  / no one understands.
<|endoftext|>
He stood once more no strength remained / His soles and soul succumb / His heart of stone lay shattered, still / His song a beating drum.
<|endoftext|>
Who cares about the pop-off trees / of Provence? / A road’s a road
<|endoftext|>
We were best friends / Inseparable. / When only one of us is out, they would ask about the missing half. / We spent an unhealthy amount of time together. / Just / New friends / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
I'd ask him why some kids have to grow up without parents at all / If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him if there was a "plan b" / Because obviously "plan g-o-d" isn't working
<|endoftext|>
“Yes. A spider. Of unreasonable size  / yes. I tell you, Matilda, you let these  / little fuckers crawl around and they / think they own the place.”
<|endoftext|>
Sometimes / I fall apart / because I spilled water all over the table / and I can’t stop myself from repeating over and over / “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” / because I’m such a disappointment
<|endoftext|>
Who broke off pieces of your life, one by one  / slowly peeling you back  / layer by layer  / until you were raw and exposed and / said- / "this is how it ought to be."
<|endoftext|>
this smells of vivacious verbs and active adjectives  / a syntactic aphrodisiac leading you / to the friction of fingers on a keyboard. / how many of these until you fall in love?
<|endoftext|>
Being found at the beginning of a thumb / Tightly grasping four fingers / And delivered / On the rocks.
<|endoftext|>
But to avoid melodrama  / and an uncomfortable silence  / I’ll bite it back and say  / “I’m doing okay.”  / Yeah  / I’m doing just fine.
<|endoftext|>
fuck flattery success money / all I do is lie back and suck my thumb
<|endoftext|>
if you don't break rules you're an ass not human / women start us passion comes and goes until death
<|endoftext|>
Glow worms / brightly sleeping / On my flowers
<|endoftext|>
so I exhaled quick  / poured it out  / and that was that.
<|endoftext|>
The storm, / like Dostoevsky / Builds up as it lists
<|endoftext|>
Four in morning / creak my mother / In her bed
<|endoftext|>
Today, i fear- ive lost all sense, all meaning and understanding of the word.  / I sit here dumbfounded as a child on their first christmas and as in awe as a zealous man witnessing his god.
<|endoftext|>
Satisfied, the pine / bough washing / In the waters
<|endoftext|>
And just like my city / I want your pity / But not your solutions / Because I rely on my pollutants
<|endoftext|>
Shall I heed God’s commandment? / wave breaking / On the rocks -
<|endoftext|>
The mind of the flower / regards my mind / Externally
<|endoftext|>
I am willing to bet / That this sidewalk is the wrong kind of rough on my bare heels, it must not heat up the same way it used to / That the wind won't blow my skirt up no matter how many times I wear that peach stained dress again.
<|endoftext|>
Drugs are made to be did, kid. / And yes, I know how that sounds  / Ignorant and belligerent. / I keep it real, hedonistic  / Shameless, and overself-indulgent.
<|endoftext|>
Oh moon, / such dismay? / Earths betray
<|endoftext|>
Someone talk to me please / I got to find a reason to live / HELP ME
<|endoftext|>
and i will go to jail / and i will lose my scholarship / and i will lose my anal virginity / why did i quit drugs?
<|endoftext|>
The sleeping moth / he doesn’t know / The lamps turned up again
<|endoftext|>
Before I left for university she finally said it: / “I’m breaking up with you” in no uncertain terms; I read it / From my phone through tears, asked why, but deep down knew the point was moot. / I lost my heart that dreadful day, and lost my mind to boot.
<|endoftext|>
Iowa clouds / following each other / Into Eternity
<|endoftext|>
i hope things will get better for us someday / me and you / happy / together / in the inarticulable future / please do not lose hope
<|endoftext|>
why is there wrapping paper under the couch  / haven't you cleaned since christmas  / what album is this  / do you even like Lana Del Rey  / how much did that sweater cost  / why does it look so small on you
<|endoftext|>
Stare intently / at my candle / Pool of wax
<|endoftext|>
Huge knot in the / Redwood tree / Looking like Zeus’ face
<|endoftext|>
Haiku, shmaiku, I cant / understand the intention / of reality
<|endoftext|>
and text you / where is my phone / can you call / it can you call me / can you hear me can / you tell by the longitude / of my lexicon that our
<|endoftext|>
the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning / is the faint glimmer of hope that things will be better today / and that i will not be anxious
<|endoftext|>
they used sticks and yells and other tricks those fakes / this person reaches high low like sunlight
<|endoftext|>
it doesn't matter what his sign says.
<|endoftext|>
Gull sailing / in the saffron sky / The Holy Ghost wanted it
<|endoftext|>
six years of hunger sitting like a secret in darkness / his bones pierced with the less-and-less the near-nothing
<|endoftext|>
Velvet horses / in the valley auction / Woman sings
<|endoftext|>
Breakfast done / the tomcat curls up / On the down couch
<|endoftext|>
Clears her throat / Kisses a homely, sonorous alto / Into the air
<|endoftext|>
The rows upon rows of nameless foes. / All they know is what they've been told; / That war is peace / And peace cannot be gained without war.
<|endoftext|>
She’ll turn you inside out and take away everything that makes you alive. You’ll forget you were ever anything but words scrawled onto scrap pieces of paper.
<|endoftext|>
Sometimes / it feels like my hands will never stop shaking / and my words will never land gracefully  / but instead fall like glass / to shatter on the floor / in a stuttering apology / because I don’t know what else to say or do
<|endoftext|>
“Hi! So okay, I know I’m a stranger  / and that you don’t know me  / and I don’t know you
<|endoftext|>
I don't know. / I feel like everyone hates me... and I'm just someone people "deal with". / Dependent.
<|endoftext|>
aspirations shut tight like pearls in clams  / moonlight in my hands  / reminiscing lambent plankton
<|endoftext|>
Early morning with the / happy dogs / I forgot the Path
<|endoftext|>
Leaves falling everywhere / in the November / Midnight moonshine
<|endoftext|>
from their / pupils: / “what is your favorite constellation?” / and  / smiling in that half-madness
<|endoftext|>
The dog yawned / and almost swallowed / My Dharma
<|endoftext|>
Wash hung out / by moonlight / Friday night
<|endoftext|>
Hand in hand in a red valley / with the universal schoolteacher / the first morning
<|endoftext|>
Full moon, white snow, / my bottle / Of purple jello
<|endoftext|>
beer has moved on; why can’t I? / And that’s why beer is a poet  / and I’m just a sad drunk - still / coming to grips with suicide.
<|endoftext|>
A long way from / The Beat Generation / In the rain forest
<|endoftext|>
Sweet sorrow / hello again
<|endoftext|>
When will this disease go away? / I'm sick of trying. / Every day is a struggle.
<|endoftext|>
we wonder if our parents ever felt this way  / chests bursting with a hopeful less-feeling / because the night sky says what we can't figure out how to phrase  / and a fifth of fireball says what we can't bring ourselves to say
<|endoftext|>
I should've seen the signs / And tried to keep her nearer
<|endoftext|>
I guess we just fell out of love, were never meant to grow  / It's now awful silent in my house here all alone.  / And in my mind, I saw a list of guys you used to know / So I took it and signed my name.
<|endoftext|>
And said I couldn't go / "Me first!" you whispered / As if you could know / It was only cancer / We've got so much to do / I was thirty years old / When I loved you / My body numbed
<|endoftext|>
The colors are all so vivid  / And the dialogue is scripted. / These life roles, we just fill in  / With some broken down commitments. / Mindset atavistic
<|endoftext|>
Perfect circle round / the moon / In the center of the sky
<|endoftext|>
As you grew older, we didn't mean to smother / We backed away, enough space to hover / We wanted you to be happy like when you were younger
<|endoftext|>
When we sneak away into our seashell stashes / we rattle them in our hands / like underwater windchimes / and imagine how they sounded / clattering up and away from the ocean
<|endoftext|>
But neither was I. / Things happen. / People change. / And I still love you despite it all.
<|endoftext|>
and they landed in the grass / and i looked for them / and it was very dark / and i could not find them / and i do not know where they are
<|endoftext|>
White-walled wheels / Before Detroit / Became a punchline.
<|endoftext|>
Arrived at university, but wasn’t really there. / Amid new friends, good weed, cheap drinks, hot girls, I didn’t care. / We still talked some, but I could tell she didn’t really want to  / Then silence came from her for one fortnight after a few. …
<|endoftext|>
Greyhound bus, / flowing all night, / Virginia
<|endoftext|>
hope god is real so i can try this again and / maybe not fuck up so bad a second / time although for all i know this is the  / hundredth time i've been given a life and / squandered it so maybe i

Autumn nite / Lucien leans to Jack / on the couch.
<|endoftext|>
Is your head occasionally / Plotting against you? / Do you suddenly want to / Kill yourself at
<|endoftext|>
The needle won't reach the record  / And the smile doesn't quite reach the eyes  / And my brain can't reach around  / Why his warmth didn't reach inside.
<|endoftext|>
Mom's curly hair is too busy  / Washing the dishes  / And taking care of the laundry  / To be curly again.
<|endoftext|>
and suddenly everything that once was sweet / is now clingy / and the only way to win / is to admit defeat
<|endoftext|>
everyone who wants / to be in it to little spoon / me if they don’t lie to / me I will like their band / a lot and go to all their shows / and when they do witchcraft / I will profess that I am hexed
<|endoftext|>
another house has its own path through the dark / what about when moss grows on the heart’s road
<|endoftext|>
But since that’s all I am / I was never untrue / Lovely limbs and flushed cheeks / Quick wit, hopes and dreams
<|endoftext|>
Tonight I'll lower / my tail / I've seen them around town
<|endoftext|>
you can't be anyone but you / therefore you are that Other one you love
<|endoftext|>
Buddha laughing / on Mt. Lanka! / Like Jimmy Durante!
<|endoftext|>
A tear in his seams / Has wounded his dreams / And upon him, slowly, death creeps
<|endoftext|>
Only seven since the winds and glints / hovered around her headstone / and raised some disagreement: / A thousand gusts chilled the bone  / yet that afternoon our pale gold / Sun had brightly shone  / and Under Pressure faintly played / with Freddie Mercury alone.
<|endoftext|>
in different headwraps and ways of weaving floormats and bathroom habits / but at the end of every day / All everyone wants is a hot meal a good fuck a stiff drink and a cuddle
<|endoftext|>
I wrote a hundred songs / And all of them are gone.
<|endoftext|>
My girlfriend took a train / To go to the St. Patrick's Day Parade  / With another man.
<|endoftext|>
Autumn night in New Haven / the Whippenpoofers / Singing on the train
<|endoftext|>
There’s no Buddha / because / There’s no me
<|endoftext|>
Damn, another lonely night.  / Damn, fill the upright shot glass.
<|endoftext|>
Why the hell is it getting worse?
<|endoftext|>
In the chair / I decided to call Haiku / By the name of Pop
<|endoftext|>
a butterfly hovers in front of her face / how long will she sleep
<|endoftext|>
And now he can tell / That in this living hell / That he’d wishes he’d just let them stay
<|endoftext|>
(in hopes of reconnecting to the / emotions we lost in the digital abyss).
<|endoftext|>
Great like choice found / On the end / Of a coat-hanger.
<|endoftext|>
Why should I even try? / Everything's going to shit. / Why bother?
<|endoftext|>
Girls' footprints / in the sand / Old mossy pile
<|endoftext|>
On Desolation / I was the alonest man / in the world
<|endoftext|>
The whole city's on xanax. / Thanks  / what's-her-face. / Let them rain from the sky / like little
<|endoftext|>
i could not blame you when / you grew wings and flew away / my crane wife
<|endoftext|>
They say time heals all wounds. / Now I don't know if that's true, but I will tell you a year doesn't cut it. / One day you will see that you weren't wrong.
<|endoftext|>
I am eager for breath  / But a twinge of worry - / for missing the depth  / And so I tarry.
<|endoftext|>
Love is our thing. / I am not yours  / and you are not mine. / We are / You and I.
<|endoftext|>
don't wait for the man standing in the snow / to cut off his arm help him now
<|endoftext|>
The windmills of / Oklahoma look / In every direction
<|endoftext|>
Trees cant reach / for a glass / Of water
<|endoftext|>
I called Hanshan / in the fog / Silence, it said
<|endoftext|>
If you had God's phone number / I'd tell you to not bother texting him / I'd tell you to delete it
<|endoftext|>
If I go out now, / my paws / will get wet
<|endoftext|>
do you remember the time / we drove to the mountains and it snowed / and i kissed your cold sweet lips / and we defrosted our feet / under warm wool sheets
<|endoftext|>
From handgun of virility / Come soldiers of fertility / Agile paratroopers of sex / Meet stifling kleenex
<|endoftext|>
Back on XANAX and Lexapro. / Not making progress, running out of options. / I'm scared that I've hit a really low point in my life, with no way to climb back up.
<|endoftext|>
And if you wish to be without me / Then that's perfect too / You are the best thing that'll never happen to me
<|endoftext|>
I have the bitter praise of jealous men / Who gaze at you and long to take my place. / They stare at me and try to comprehend / What gifts I have to match your love and grace.
<|endoftext|>
Walking down road with Allen / Walking down the road in Autumn.
<|endoftext|>
and snuck out to the hudson / and threw them in the river / and missed / and felt very dumb and unmovie-like
<|endoftext|>
I called Hanshan / in the mountains / there was no answer
<|endoftext|>
The crickets crying / for rain / Again?
<|endoftext|>
A turtle sailing along / on a log, / Head up
<|endoftext|>
Nodding against the wall, / the flowers / Sneeze
<|endoftext|>
I wish too / I wish she / Didn’t make me / Thirsty  / With her souvenir  / That beer / Our fears / Our tears
<|endoftext|>
Before you were born / Remember anything? / calm down  / It's the same thing
<|endoftext|>
Spring rain, / Kicking stones / An arrowhead
<|endoftext|>
Rain in North Caroline / the saints / Are still meditating
<|endoftext|>
Who taught you to destroy things out of compassion?
<|endoftext|>
I order a drink: / It's brown swill  / But the buzzing in the back of my throat, like a herd of bees  / Drowns the sound of my thoughts.
<|endoftext|>
Her appearance became fewer / Like flowers approaching winter
<|endoftext|>
I ask you answer I don't you don't / O Lord Bodidharma what's in your unknown heart
<|endoftext|>
Lonesome blubbers / grinding out the decades / with wet lips
<|endoftext|>
Thompson’s acid caps / for Chinese research chemicals
<|endoftext|>
A bubble, a shadow / woop / The lightning flash
<|endoftext|>
and he stuck it in my butt  / and i wished  / it was a cucumber  / and – god!
<|endoftext|>
Autumn night stove / I’ve never been / on a farm before.
<|endoftext|>
They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something. / If that is true then I am a master of sleeping alone. / Nights upon nights of twin mattresses  / I racked up hours  / Nine at a time  / To be the best at being alone.
<|endoftext|>
Ah, the crickets / are screaming / at the moon
<|endoftext|>
Later that night I dialed  / your number  / but then I remembered you quit
<|endoftext|>
Zen's finished stick your brain in a peach branch guzzle sake / sing until you have no throat then words come by themselves
<|endoftext|>
I love taking my new girl blind Mori on a spring picnic / I love seeing her exquisite free face its moist sexual heat shine
<|endoftext|>
this world this thing you and I call knowing / those ten words these fifty-four-year-old fingers are everything
<|endoftext|>
Beautiful summer night / gorgeous as the robes / Of Jesus
<|endoftext|>
Dawn – the first / robins singing / to the new moon
<|endoftext|>
I wrote your name and signed the letter  / Finally told you how I felt and though I thought that I'd get better  / I cannot seem to calm the tides that crash so violent on the sides of my mind
<|endoftext|>
i want to punch you in the face with my dick
<|endoftext|>
A lakeside sunrise like blood in the water  / Half hearted musings of meaningless slaughter  / Lifetimes of heartache and wasted ambition  / Carelessness curses the human condition
<|endoftext|>
Douchebag
<|endoftext|>
Close your eyes / Landlord knocking / On the back door
<|endoftext|>
do you remember the time / i lied / and i cursed myself for being such a foolish man / and i made promises i thought i could keep
<|endoftext|>
Ship paint / on / An old T-shirt
<|endoftext|>
I sat right here, looked in that mirror / and had a slightly rounder face  / because when I was here five weeks ago / I was in a different place.
<|endoftext|>
There’s a bump on a part of this gypsy man’s cart / And it thumps with each turn of the wheel. / It keeps him in time with his plucking and rhyme / As he rides it from Rome to Castile.
<|endoftext|>
but very recently I’ve / come to the realization / that the number of people we meet / in this world isn’t nearly
<|endoftext|>
so i knew it was very serious / he made me feel bad about myself  / which is ironic because that's exactly why i started doing drugs in the first place / to get a few hours of relief
<|endoftext|>
August in Salinas / Autumn leaves in / Clothing store displays
<|endoftext|>
she is here, now, unbelievably: / hands newly wedded to clean-cut nails / and a duckling-yellow raincoat / rests at her shoulders.
<|endoftext|>
You died today  / There is nothing I can say. / I am lost in our home looking at what was. / Last night's supper still waits for you on the table... / The last time we touched, I was angry at you, and I'm sorry.
<|endoftext|>
You said that you liked peeling oranges  / Liberating the fragile life that’s been walled off  / I said that it seemed intrusive  / You said that it was satisfying
<|endoftext|>
and drink topshelf liquor at thirdworld prices. / They all just want to wear harem pants / and fill their pockets
<|endoftext|>
Morning sun / The purple petals, / Four have fallen
<|endoftext|>
Maybe if the sidewalk widened, or the sailor had more skill / Or if I didn't need to take so many pills / Or if my feet stopped dangling over this window sill  / The things I do to feel alive will come in for the kill
<|endoftext|>
We'll try again  / tomorrow. / Won't we?
<|endoftext|>
none of the black curtains in her room / even had a window underneath / and i wondered if a sleepy cigarette death / would be our only relief that night
<|endoftext|>
Self-reflections. / How could you could make your death look accidental?
<|endoftext|>
"you're a peach" she said / as i held the door for her. we found / a maintenance hallway perfect for sneaking / into the movie theater after it had closed. / it would be just one of
<|endoftext|>
The little worm / lowers itself from the roof / By a self shat thread
<|endoftext|>
June – the snow / of blossoms / On the ground
<|endoftext|>
the way she is now: / twenty-three years and I know people / change, but she changed / from jalapeños and tequila / to homegrown jasmine / and touches of black pepper without / asking me to taste her.
<|endoftext|>
because I knew it was just alcohol and loneliness / but my god, I’ll never forget your hand on the back of my neck / and the love story your tongue told mine
<|endoftext|>
deserve to live and die alone without / joy or pleasure in my / days and the sun is coming up soon but / i can't seem to fall asleep because i can't stop / worrying about where my life is and is not
<|endoftext|>
Rainy night, / the top leaves wave / In the grey sky
<|endoftext|>
In the desert sun / in Arizona, / A yellow railroad caboose
<|endoftext|>
And you want to be on the other side  / So your nail scrapes the skin  / And there is an exhalation of vapor  / A burst of luminous droplets
<|endoftext|>
No imaginary judgments / of form, / The clouds
<|endoftext|>
Mist before the peak / the dream / Goes on
<|endoftext|>
November how nasal / the drunken / Conductor's call
<|endoftext|>
I tie the noose as I lose hope / Still hanging on, but by a rope
<|endoftext|>
it isn't that we're alone or not alone / whose voice do you want mine? yours?

Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation? / My body overtook my mind / We broke the promise to stay just friends / and for the first time in a long time I didn't care / I guess I didn't care too much / Because I didn't bother asking if / You were still hers.

I wonder How they've been? / Sick / Older / Surrounded by family and friends. / Except one. / The kids are looking through your old photos with you. / Who is that? / You read the obituaries. / You almost forgot they existed. / I guess they don't anymore. / You cry at the funeral. / The kids had to ask. / Who was that?

Reaching out for freedom  / He sang a final song. / He floated out of reach- / Drowned his demons in the dawn.

The creamer gives, / the groaner quakes / the angel smiles

This is my poem to a girl in my class / Who sits and listens with such passionate interest / Overtaken by shyness she never participates / She reads her poetry book and takes notes on her favorites / The person I want to be is shown through her intelligence
<|endoftext|>
Summer afternoon / impatiently chewing / The jasmine leaf
<|endoftext|>
Is this the land of great resource be found? / How tall the pines and strong the maples rise  / O'er fields of grains that moor the fertile ground  / And mighty mountains pierce the western skies. / . / Oh, should we place a thousand ships to sea  / To cast their nets and pluck the endless cod  / The salty depths would still more gracious be  / Till pious men fatigue the ears of God. / . / But blessed lands repay with blood from men  / Oh how their lustful yearnings must be filled. / They turn their might to loose the sword again  / And blight the land as blood and tears are spilled. / . / The rightful heirs have paid for hallowed lands  / And mourn for us the blood still on our hands.

Some spend their life  / In search of the center  / Desperately looking  / Ignoring others who enter.

I’m eighty still alive looking up every night / snapping my fingers at time at the promise of love
<|endoftext|>
But I still remember you  / blood beading on your forearms from the time you climbed that tree / whose trunk was thick as the words which had caught in your throat / and you could barely manage to grip its sides.

Our bond thus made she led me now / I watched her play intrigued at how  / In little things she took delight / Like flowers, trees and other sights  / She taught me much about the world; / So walked the fox and I.

Evening coming / The office girl / unloosing her scarf

I’m not a poet. The beer is. / The beer is typing. The beer has / written and deleted six poems tonight. / The beer is cheap. I bought it at  / a rural gas station coming back

The red roof of the barn / is ravelled / Like familiar meat

And you remember the warm embrace of your mother  / And the loving touch of her hands  / And you wonder why that went away  / And you want so badly to replace it

The bitterness and anger between / You and I / Are gone, like the ashes of the fire.

Cat eating fish heads / All those eyes / In the starlight / Catfish fighting for his life, / and winning, / Splashing us all / Cat gone 24 hours / A piece of his hair / Waving on the door

Picking at the bracelet that bore my name and "21M" / Waiting for a mediocre meal that never even came / Noticing the dirt and grime covering the floors / I suddenly felt an irreversible shame

Grain elevators, waiting / for the road / To approach them

If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him if it was hard to condemn his son to death to absolve our sins only to have the world end up like this / I'd ask him, from father to son why some kids have to grow up without parents that love them

<|endoftext|>
Rainy night / I put on / My pajamas
<|endoftext|>
While my knuckles bled and my fingertips blistered, while I fell on my knees and trenched them to free the twisted cartilage inside, ripped pages out of books for attention, clanged pots and pans together and built bonfire skeletons from sonnets, wedging them under my bed instead, she waited

Was it our fault? We still wonder / To walk into your room, where I discover / Your body still swinging, like in summer
<|endoftext|>
Ah the birds / at dawn, / my mother and father
<|endoftext|>
(never have to update your resume) / seriously, i should've made a move.  / (never have to take out the fucking trash again) / i'd never have to take out the fucking trash again  / (go take out the fucking trash) / i'm busy
<|endoftext|>
If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him where he was during my depression / Why he watched my recession toward death and did nothing about it / I lost track of how many messages I've sent to him that could've been my last words
<|endoftext|>
believe in the man facing you now / just narrow your eyes feel the deep love
<|endoftext|>
Waiting with me for / the end of this ephemeral / Existence – the moon
<|endoftext|>
but now as I am staring down death himself / who commissioned the hate of an entire country to do his work / I miss your gunfire more than I miss you
<|endoftext|>
Do they still have mornings / in Sacramento? / Will I be able to have  / and feel / a slow time, bright / and mine
<|endoftext|>
The bones in her hands shifted / as she fixed her hair into a ponytail. / "You're going to promise me that  / you're not going to try to fix me. / You're going to promise me, okay?" / And so I did.
<|endoftext|>
Autumnal / Cowflops / but a man must / make a living.
<|endoftext|>
a well nobody dug filled with no water / ripples and a shapeless weightless man drinks
<|endoftext|>
The alarm clock will go off with or without her  / I'll work for something else tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
Some searchers give up  / Saying there's no end at all.  / Only more circles and turns  / It's just wall after wall.
<|endoftext|>
i said i’m sorry i've ruined your night  / i should go.
<|endoftext|>
Man dying / Harbor lights / On still water
<|endoftext|>
Anyone else here feel like loneliness is the biggest reason for their depression? / Talking to other people isn't pleasurable. I think I'm fucking crazy. / Lonely and wishing I was dead.
<|endoftext|>
A balloon caught / in the tree – dusk / In Central Park zoo
<|endoftext|>
I feel the depression coming back, I'm scared of losing my boyfriend.

a crazy lecher shuttling back and forth between whorehouse and bar / this past master paints south north east west with his cock
<|endoftext|>
If I had God's phone number / The first thing I'd ask is, "wait how did I get this number?" / But the first thing I'd ask God is, "what's up with Jaden Smith, like really?" / And the second thing I'd say is
<|endoftext|>
It’s been so long since I’ve been afflicted / I think the pain somehow got me addicted / So even though we’ve done this before / Hurt me more / Hurt me more
<|endoftext|>
one half-thawed lovesong chilly as dusk remains / my life stalking hills now these shameful purple robes
<|endoftext|>
february meant we quit the job where we met. somehow it was okay  / and i met her family by accident. / i slept at her parent's house
<|endoftext|>
Rhythmic movements  / Like a fast-paced dripping tap / That he turned on as he wished. / Me following, pretending I'm experienced in this. / Everything forgotten by me as it happened  / Everything forgotten by him as he left.
<|endoftext|>
That I can be / A better mistake / Next time
<|endoftext|>
I fear that time and space no longer matter.  / Nor fear of death itself. / There only exists you.  / And i.  / And the deafening silence between us
<|endoftext|>
and heck isn’t scary if we / both go itll be like doing / drugs when my mom wasn’t / home in the garage we invented
<|endoftext|>
The meadow grass waved / to the whim of the breeze; / Those shooting stars fell to the will of black seas. / But I and the moonlight  / ’Til nighttime had passed  / Just sat there alone in that sweet meadow grass.
<|endoftext|>
Without getting high / Without getting down on myself / Wishing I were someone else / Without ingesting these chemicals to fill my head with instant miracles
<|endoftext|>
Bach through an open / dawn window / the birds are silent
<|endoftext|>
Giving an apple / to the mule, the big lips / Taking hold
<|endoftext|>
they do it in the street in broad daylight like cows and horses / it’s late the moon goes under west of Ch’ang-an
<|endoftext|>
Work of the quiet / mountain, this / Torrent of purity
<|endoftext|>
I live in a shack on the edge of whorehouse row / me autumn a single candle
<|endoftext|>
That's an unencouraging sign, / the fish store / is closed
<|endoftext|>
Two clouds kissing / backed up to look / At each other
<|endoftext|>
Looking around to think / I saw the thick white cloud / Above the house
<|endoftext|>
I'm pure shame / what I do and what I say never the same
<|endoftext|>
even in its scabbard my sword / sees you
<|endoftext|>
The shame / The shame, the shame of it all tore / me to bits and the next hours blurred
<|endoftext|>
I made raspberry fruit jello / The color of rubies / In the setting sun

he’s good company and doesn’t  / care that I’m hurting because he  / doesn’t care about much and I  / don’t want to care about anything / at all.
<|endoftext|>
I was reunited with this old feeling / And briefly, actually thought I was healing / But you merely thought of love as a chore / So you’ve hurt me more / Hurt me more

The mule, turning / slowly, rubbing his / Behind on a log
<|endoftext|>
latitude has me emotive / like happy / like im dumb enough / to maybe be happy / that im too tall for this / twin sized bed but / there is still room for

“How will I know?” / He asked.

Everyone of my knocks / disturbs my daughter / Sleeping in her December grave
<|endoftext|>
Beauty's such a finite thing / That's lost when it is won;  / There's just not enough to go around.  / But look...! / I caught the sun.
<|endoftext|>
What have the fates brought to me today? / A herald, here to deliver me from the monotony of mundanity? / A lover, here to explore uncharted vistas of my soul? / A hitler, here to lead me to madness and to ruin?
<|endoftext|>
Ignoring my bread, / the bird peeking / In the grass
<|endoftext|>
Congratulations! / We text you on the day your first is born. / We aren't there. / It would have been weird. / What's the baby's name again? / What color balloon do we send? / Families / New friends. / Passing time.

what was that for  / what did the wall do  / was that a fucking stud  / are you ok  / can you drive  / how is this my fault

They wash their cracked hands, their labored faces, their souls for imperfections, but / The dirt never leaves their lungs, their muddy breath forced to cough and croak songs without music.

I was twelve years old / When I loved you / My finger trembled / The lights were dim / I said yes / On a hope and a whim

Sunday in a bar / in Woodland Calif. / One noon beer

High noon / in Northport / Alien shore

His own mind betrayed / Wants not to be saved / So alone, there he sits, until dead.

I found my love in blues-note riff  / in Bloom County, in Spaceman Spiff  / in beds with legs and mice with bricks - / again, the needle my thumb pricks.

My cat eating / at his saucer / Spring moon

i decided to throw out all my drugs  / so i put them in a raisin box / and put my jacket on / and put my hood up / and felt very cool and movie-like
<|endoftext|>
i want to get away from here / just up and leave one day / with a bag of clothes and some money / maybe a toothbrush, too / maybe not
<|endoftext|>
After the shower / my cat meowing / on the porch
<|endoftext|>
Then suddenly one day, we fell apart without a clue / We're talking less and laughing less and keep on feeling blue. / Get the check, by myself, at a table set for two  / So I took it and signed my name.
<|endoftext|>
Not from her touch but cool air coming through my open window. / And I remember / The only constant in life is change.

Some days when I look at the ocean she is a quilt of belonging / ivory infinity folding over and over itself. / Other days she is the silver specter of regret

Father, Vater, Père, Pater. / Mr., Sir, Sergeant, Private. / All lost for a worthless cause. / After all, rifles cannot distinguish between

Such simple splendour we then felt / As boy and fox on hilltop knelt / And watched the world for some short while / Repose devoid of care nor trial / A quiet place where time stood still; / So knelt the fox and I.
<|endoftext|>
A whole pussywillow / over there, / Unblown

Which postal service can send my picture to outer space? / I scoured up & down I-95 / searched in dank alleyways / Because I desperately want all the cosmos

Days  / now fade to black.

Rock rosed – behind the Casbah / the sun has disappearing act

We get new jobs, but we stay close. / Our time together goes from daily. / To weekly. / To "brunch every Sunday" / To "Oh my God, has it been a month? We can't let that happen again!" / We will.
<|endoftext|>
Having a hard time eating / i think i'm going to start drinking

Me, you – you, me / Everybody / He-he

Loves his own belly / The way I love my life, / The white cat

I am the discovered girl  / a marionette who cut her strings.  / A continent, pristine and pure  / unclaimed by concrete queens and kings.
<|endoftext|>
what I’m trying to say is you’re very beautiful! / And to be a hundred percent honest with you  / if I didn’t at least ask your name  / why  / I’d be as bitter as this black coffee! / Ha!”
<|endoftext|>
and eventually i would ride under a clothesline and acquire a new skin; a better one / i'd also bump my head on a low-hanging street lamp and my brain would fall out with a resigned squelch / and along the way i would pick up a new brain from a black market organ dealer in chicago
<|endoftext|>
blissfully out of my own mind and / This morning I awoke to find / a text from myself that read:
<|endoftext|>
Have your rest, make peace with death  / Then rise! Resolve anew. / Let anger ring with steadfast silence  / And actions with purpose true.
<|endoftext|>
Walking over the water / my shadow, / Heavier than lead

All the insects ceased / in honor / Of the moon

WARM WIND / makes the pines / Talk Deep

photographs / my hair turned the shade of rust / i climbed barbed wire fences to force / myself inside of my head

First December cold / wave not even / One cricket

Birds flew / Over the shack / Rejoicing

”The old pond, yes! / the water jumped into / By a frog”

The pine woods / move / In the mist

why was the radio playing Summertime Sadness  / why does the ER have a radio  / what was the point of buying that sweater  / why do you still wear it  / do you think it will fit over your cast  / did they give you a choice on the color  / isn't there enough purple in there

He slips out of bed and quietly gets dressed  / tries not to disturb the young girl at rest. / His breath reeks of whiskey and cheap cigarettes  / he turns and sighs softly, heart full of regrets.

The moon / is a / Blind lemon

Red trees / the dog tears at / an old itch.

Ghengis Khan looks fiercely / east, with red eyes, / Hungering for Autumn vengeance
<|endoftext|>
O for / Vermont again / The barn on an Autumn night
<|endoftext|>
The birds / surprise me / On all sides
<|endoftext|>
I found hell in a gas station in the humdrum slums of farmland California; / In the eyes of the wretched gatekeepers living in the neon hope of the gas prices; / The town of twenty trapped by tilled trenches tasked with too much time;
<|endoftext|>
Great again. / Great like ball games / And road trips  / American flags / And church potlucks.

Crazy Cloud likes his own mind its wish for flutesongs rainy nights / drinking muttering beside his women
<|endoftext|>
Bird was gone / and distance grew / Immensely white
<|endoftext|>
"So, is me having super powers off the table" or / "no seriously, what is up with Jaden Smith?" / I'd ask him
<|endoftext|>
Perfectly silent / in the starry night, / the little tree
<|endoftext|>
Mist falling / Purple flowers / Growing
<|endoftext|>
Bee, why are you / staring at me? / I'm not a flower!
<|endoftext|>
Do I have an intellectual disability? / I have no idea what to do. / I think I'm dumb. / I don't know how to deal with this.

Barley soup in Scotland / in November / Misery everywhere
<|endoftext|>
Kiss me like / rough, behind the laundromat / I need you so / torrid, needful, calloused hands / fuck! you drive me / poolside at a cheap motel / be quick, love, be
<|endoftext|>
It happened tonight. / After a long time, I find my reason to try. / Heart pounding?
<|endoftext|>
raging in the now hungry for it / crows rattle the air no dust
<|endoftext|>
this brick house I live in is really the sky / and just as priceless
<|endoftext|>
then i woke up and my brain was screaming the word 'fuck' in a very monotonous and half-heartedly drawn out way / it was going
<|endoftext|>
how, even after your business trips  / you were too tired to brush a strand of her / hair back or at least pretend to care. / now, you must practice the art of dismembering
<|endoftext|>
Remember when you asked if you could kiss me?  / The light in my head went off. / We broke the barrier of friendship / and for the first time in a long time I felt hope / I guess my hopes were too high / When I realized  / You were still hers.
<|endoftext|>
this has been going on for years / i really hope he's not a liberal arts major / one of these days he'll be unemployed
<|endoftext|>
I woke up / two flies were boffing / On my forehead
<|endoftext|>
The Angel’s hair / trailed on my chin / Like a cobweb
<|endoftext|>
used to feel at home with friends / i used to feel at home / i used to feel / i
<|endoftext|>
i have no friends and no future prospects and i'm poor and feel inferior to everyone and my life is shit / i am writing a poetry collection to express how sad i am and to maybe come to terms with it and embark on the long process of self-acceptance and rehabilitation
<|endoftext|>
Everything is worse at night. / I don't kill myself for the same reasons I want to.
<|endoftext|>
my mind can’t answer when you call / if it did I’d be stealing your life from you
<|endoftext|>
so I exhaled quick  / shook my head  / and that was that.
<|endoftext|>
my brain and i do not get along / he is a leo while i am a taurus  / one night he wakes me up at 3 am / it is the middle of the night so i was dreaming
<|endoftext|>
don’t worry please please how many times do I have to say it / there’s no way not to be who you are and where.
<|endoftext|>
True love is not found  / It lies in your heart.  / We search for an end  / Which we had at the start.
<|endoftext|>
"Just sticks with thorns", I say. / He laughs again.
<|endoftext|>
I’ve built cemeteries on skyscrapers / using only grave mistakes  / and the knowledge that if I fell / I’ll be returned straight to the scenes of / crimes I’ve implicated myself in.
<|endoftext|>
I mean, I really- / Just seeing you happy / Made summer better.
<|endoftext|>
nobody cares about my hungers thirsts / smash the plum blossom's one night's ice
<|endoftext|>
for a glimmer of your feathers / wings dipped in moonlight / darling, we used to tiptoe on
<|endoftext|>
and a macbook / and go to starbucks / and i will write poetry / and it will be poetic
<|endoftext|>
The earth keeps turning / like a dreary / Immortal
<|endoftext|>
Read my lips, he says  / and burps.
<|endoftext|>
Sweet birds, chordless / except in another / Clime
<|endoftext|>
I reached for my pack  / of reds  / but then I remembered I quit  / awhile  / ago
<|endoftext|>
books koans sitting miss the heart but not fishermen's songs / rain pelts the river I sing beyond all of it
<|endoftext|>
I’m up here in the hills starving myself / but I’ll come down for you
<|endoftext|>
i have this theory / i'm in the middle of a car crash / right now  / i'm seven years old
<|endoftext|>
Writing modern lovesongs on iPhones  / Standing in line waiting for coffee
<|endoftext|>
Butterfat soil / of the valley / Big black slugs
<|endoftext|>
even Rinzai's disciples don't know / so many ordinary people know but don't know they know / walking to work talking to themselves
<|endoftext|>
outrageous eyes ears nose in the cold one silent tinkling bell / clear beautiful nudged by the wind hangs over the polished railing
<|endoftext|>
Three little sparrows / on the roof / Talking quietly, sadly
<|endoftext|>
Then one day you left; / The lullaby left too.
<|endoftext|>
Alone at home reading / Yoka Daishi, / Drinking tea
<|endoftext|>
reach down inside my weary bones  / pluck the birthmarks off my arms / and legs / and torso / one by one / like dying flowers  / bend down and kiss away
<|endoftext|>
i drink whiskey now.
<|endoftext|>
Kiss me / like you kiss her.
<|endoftext|>
Bird bath trashing, / by itself / Autumn wind
<|endoftext|>
The taste / of rain / Why kneel?
<|endoftext|>
We are best friends. / Inseparable. / When only one of us is out, they ask about the missing half. / We spend an unhealthy amount of time together. / Just. / New friends. / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
I deserve to know- / you took pieces of me after all- / How can I dress my wounds; how can I / explain my bruises; / how can I convince myself that / love does not speak from angry eyes / if I never know who the author was.
<|endoftext|>
I don’t mind;
<|endoftext|>
I’ve turned up / the lamp again / The sleeping moth
<|endoftext|>
It’s 5:30 / Too early for me / But now I can’t sleep / I have to pee / I’m thirsty / Thirsty / Always thirsty
<|endoftext|>
and i would keep riding on as a grinning skeleton / and people would stare and mutter incredulously under their breath and go to work confused or maybe call in sick and go home and lie down on their couches and wonder if they were become senile or contracting some early form of dementia
<|endoftext|>
one white blossom snow / razor-edged mountains slice my belly
<|endoftext|>
First time alone in my new apartment and I can't stop crying.
<|endoftext|>
I said it but I don't believe it / How could I really want to die / We all have pain inside but everyone else seems to get by / Why can't I
<|endoftext|>
A current pimple / In the mind’s / Old man
<|endoftext|>
One line love poem: / She's gone now.
<|endoftext|>
I found my love in kitten's purr  / in fox's squeak, in metal's burr  / in molten glass and depths of space - / still I see little of her face.
<|endoftext|>
Hot tea, in the cold / moonlit snow / a burp
<|endoftext|>
only a kind deadly sincere man / can show you the way here in the other world
<|endoftext|>
Suddenly the official / goes cross eyed / And floats away
<|endoftext|>
For a moment / the moon / Wore goggles
<|endoftext|>
Big drinking & piano / parties – Christmas / Come and gone –
<|endoftext|>
one wisp rootless shifting a dot in the blue sky / know it
<|endoftext|>
I could see he was crushed  / So I held him close.
<|endoftext|>
Sitting so close that our heartbeats syncopate  / Yet between us a gulf too deep for words to fill  / Too wide to dare to bridge.
<|endoftext|>
August Moon Universe / neither new / Nor old
<|endoftext|>
chopping up herbs blood flows from my hand into the block / no food my teacher mocks me with a smile
<|endoftext|>
The white chair is / holding its arms out / to Heaven dandelions
<|endoftext|>
The housecats, amazed / at something new, / Looking in the same direction
<|endoftext|>
In enormous blizzard / burying everything / My cat’s out mating
<|endoftext|>
We walked through the meadow  / the moonlight and me  / When night held the earth
<|endoftext|>
There’s nothing there / because / I dont care
<|endoftext|>
Wish I were a rooster / and leave my sperm / On the sidewalk, shining!
<|endoftext|>
alone with the icy moon no passion / these trees this mountain nothing else
<|endoftext|>
The streets glistened with dew-covered / people, singing what they thought. / Everybody had a map in their pocket  / they ran their fingers along in the creases / and found distinctions in the dark.
<|endoftext|>
A man sits alone / in the place he calls home / and he sits in his chair and he weeps
<|endoftext|>
The click of the receiver  / sounds like a click. / The grimace is an approximate / impression of a smile.
<|endoftext|>
In a Mojave dust storm / Albert said: "Senzeie, / Was a Mongolian waif"
<|endoftext|>
As the cool evenings / make themselves felt, / Smoke from suburban chimneys
<|endoftext|>
Listen to the birds sing! / All the little birds / Will die!
<|endoftext|>
Wake / Look around / She’s still here
<|endoftext|>
Just woke up / afternoon pines / Playing the wind
<|endoftext|>
Halloween colors / orange and black / On a summer butterfly
<|endoftext|>
this ink painting of wind blowing through pines / who hears it?
<|endoftext|>
It burned my mouth the first time you kissed me / fireball and rum and your lips against mine / it felt like heaven but hurt like hell
<|endoftext|>
You did nothing / (wrong). / I regret everything / (we won’t get to do). / I’m so(rry.)
<|endoftext|>
Oh another weekend’s / started – people squeaking / On U-turning tires
<|endoftext|>
I think there will still be / places  / and moments / and regular things.
<|endoftext|>
The cows of Autumn / laughing along the fence, / Roosters at Dawn
<|endoftext|>
In the quiet house, / my mother's / Moaning yawns
<|endoftext|>
New neighbors / light / In the old house
<|endoftext|>
Night fall too dark / to read the page, / Too dark
<|endoftext|>
On the sidewalk / A dead baby bird / For the ants
<|endoftext|>
Shall I break God's commandment? / Little fly / Rubbing its back legs
<|endoftext|>
I found my / cat one / Silent star
<|endoftext|>
I hear the swing, reminds me of summer / I used to push you on a seat of rubber / The grins you used to give your mother / The creak back and forth hitting the lumber
<|endoftext|>
I didn't choose to be sad / I'm not a magic man / I can't just wave my fucking hand / And suddenly be happy again
<|endoftext|>
The dregs of my coffee / Glisten / In the morning light
<|endoftext|>
Time keeps running out / sweat / On my brow, from playing
<|endoftext|>
I don't know if I'm depressed or not. / What's an official diagnosis?
<|endoftext|>
I gotta make it in terms /that anyone can understand/ / Did I tell ya about my nightmare?
<|endoftext|>
the girl listening to the poet bursting with poems thinks nothing / but he thinks he wants her leaning on the gate while she just listens
<|endoftext|>
from my girlfriend’s thanksgiving. / They didn’t make a lot of vegan / food. I care. The beer doesn’t. / The beer smokes cigarettes. I’m
<|endoftext|>
And as I know that smile  / I know it has never been for me / But for him.
<|endoftext|>
she said oh sorry oh sorry sorry sorry!  / you know how I get  / when I get drunk.
<|endoftext|>
And you can bet I'd be willing / To take the grimy, soggy train tickets I crumpled in my fist as we ran through the sweaty pink evening just in time to miss the train  / Cover them with orange blossom tea dregs  / Make a sacrifice and summon the gods responsible / For Sunday coming after Saturday and you leaving for school on Monday / And for this lonely fall.
<|endoftext|>
One of us gets married. / We're there. / Sort of. / We shake hands of friends we used to know. / We text our date it's time to go. / We leave the gift we just picked up. / We sipped enough champagne to meet your / New friends / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
A year goes by and for a time I really felt at peace / You took me to your parents and I met your aunt and niece / So then you took me by the hand, said "you should sign this lease" / So I took it and signed my name.
<|endoftext|>
Thanks to Coolidge, / Hoover – Hoover – but Autumn, / Roosevelt done America in
<|endoftext|>
I wanna do something but I just don't feel like it. / I just want to be alone. I hate feeling lonely.
<|endoftext|>
What is stranger than a stranger? / A meeting 13 billion years in the making. / What countless causes conspired for this coincidence of conditions?
<|endoftext|>
This plane is starting to / Tailspin / This plane / This gas mask / The clouds / Falling / Falling / Falling
<|endoftext|>
who brought these fish sizzling in the pan I’ll never stop thinking / about women white hair lust sings through my body weeds everywhere

I'd ask him if those spiteful lines of scripture on those angry peoples picket signs actually mean anything / I wonder if those bible verses were meant to sound so violent / I'd ask him if what they're saying is true because if it is, your unconditional love comes with an unconventional contract / I'd ask him "how can you be all loving with so many exceptions to your own rules?"
<|endoftext|>
Like you are brain-stuck  / vaporous / Rapidly expanding / Pushing out the indents in your skull?

sutras poems I stash them under my robe burn them all / but not words written on my heart

<|endoftext|>
The bird came on the branch / danced three times / And burred away
<|endoftext|>
fresh like new paint in an old home / i let the moths fly out / shook the drapes / changed the sheets
<|endoftext|>
to feel love again / for such time so absent / I know that smile / for when you look at me
<|endoftext|>
Wine at dawn / The long / Rainy sleep
<|endoftext|>
I'll make you understand that when you kissed me behind my ear and we said our goodbyes, I felt a lump in my throat and the beginnings of a chronic homesickness
<|endoftext|>
Do you show empathy for others? / Have you been having a hard time / Waking up? / Does it sometimes feel
<|endoftext|>
The purple wee flower / should be reflected / In that low water
<|endoftext|>
Stop slipping me / Your old Diamond Sutra / You illimitable tight-ass!
<|endoftext|>
And her breath a soft whisper on my cheek / And I almost forget that she’s an illusion / I almost forget the phone call / That shoved a fist in my throat
<|endoftext|>
Six months go by and by and you pull right over my heart / You had me at hello, we both knew that from the start / You needed help with money, asked me "can you sign my card?" / So I took it and signed my name.

Another night wasted on a girl with no name  / the affection was real, but just not the same. / The walk home will be long, but he takes it slow  / as his house is not home he'd rather not go.

night plum blossoms spreading under a branch / between her thighs narcissus revolves smell it?
<|endoftext|>
There is a huge broccoli / Next to my stuff / In the refrigerator

How cold! – late / September baseball / The crickets

Some trees still / have naked winter look / Spring day

I don’t care / the low yellow / Moon loves me

i get up and drink a glass of water because my throat is dry like i'm staring down a thousand years of mondays / the water is cool and earnest as it trickles down my throat and lands somewhere behind my ribs
<|endoftext|>
A raindrop from / the roof / Fell in my beer
<|endoftext|>
I wrote a lullaby / And sang it to you soft.
<|endoftext|>
she felt small annoyances and laughed / with strangers (what a time to be alive / and you wouldn't have seen this when we were young)  / drunk in pubs at sunday brunch / with a weak london sun attempting to breach / grimy windows.
<|endoftext|>
Love is a sticky thing. / Like an oil spill, it engulfs you / coats you, slicks you / It makes it hard to lift an arm  / open your mouth.
<|endoftext|>
for my cool sheets / fuel fever dreams / of each sweetheart / this tantric town / has ever offered.
<|endoftext|>
Now 8 months pass, there's nothing better that I have in life / You keep me on my toes like I'm dancing on a knife / The paper comes and then it says "will you be man and wife?" / So I took it and signed my name.
<|endoftext|>
They all want to tell me about their Stuff  / how they used to have so much / but now they just want to go fishing
<|endoftext|>
like a plant it blooms  / the sun feeds its crimson leaves  / I wait again until dark  / but as light no longer flows into the world.  / it occurs
<|endoftext|>
My pipe unlit / beside the Diamond / Sutra What to think?
<|endoftext|>
I found my love in trailers small  / in graphite shapes, in teacher's call  / in paper, lined both blue and straight - / and I rejoice, to pass her gate.
<|endoftext|>
So on some cool fall nights  / when my eyes tire from the glow of screens
<|endoftext|>
I should have scratched / that spot before / I started to sleep
<|endoftext|>
i don't know if it was  / disbelief / apathy / or loneliness / but i didn't listen.
<|endoftext|>
The cricket in my cellar window, this quiet / Sunday afternoon
<|endoftext|>
Great again like the mad men days / Of slinging a two-bit smile at some broad / And then a slap on the ass as she walks by / Her inner rage subdued
<|endoftext|>
The day that I became a man, by legal definition  / My girlfriend visited a while (Her medical condition / Necessitated birth control - we never used protection). / We talked a while, but due to my erection and affection
<|endoftext|>
No telegram today / Only more / Leaves fell
<|endoftext|>
He told me that travel is stupid / because the only thing it can ever teach you is that / everyone is exactly the same
<|endoftext|>
One day I met upon my way / A lovely fox who pranced and played  / In quiet awe I ceased my stride / She stopped as well but did not hide  / Her eyes I held and hers did mine; / So saw the fox and I.
<|endoftext|>
But the Lost Creek trail / they dont believe / Is in existence any more
<|endoftext|>
Why doesn't depression hurt anymore? / I may have forgotten what happiness is.

Buddhas in moonlight / Mosquito bite / thru hole in my shirt
<|endoftext|>
no masters only you the master is you / wonderful no?
<|endoftext|>
How do I cope? / I signed up for counselling today
<|endoftext|>
Nobody owes anything to anyone  / and that's how a person freezes to death / waiting for a little warmth.
<|endoftext|>
heartfelt facebook messenger conversation close to midnight but not quite
<|endoftext|>
but instead I’m talking to this guy.
<|endoftext|>
Nightfall too dark / to read the page, / Too cold
<|endoftext|>
Autumnal cowflops / a man / Makes a living.
<|endoftext|>
inside the koan clear mind / gashes the great darkness
<|endoftext|>
Late afternoon / my bare back’s / Cold
<|endoftext|>
might not be so sad like a horse in a  / stable that is waiting to die with his / best years behind him and he  / can't remember what they were and i
<|endoftext|>
To the top of the dive / "Me first!" you yelled / As you pushed me aside / I lost my balance / And fell off too
<|endoftext|>
"Milf Alert!" Johnny said / As I'm lost, floating through my own brain / "Dude", he said, as if it were my name  / "Look at the ass on that one."
<|endoftext|>
You aren’t smart when you drink
<|endoftext|>
she used to smoke us like a cigarette / between yellowed fingers / and throaty gasps.
<|endoftext|>
I’m drowning in myself / I’m drowning in myself / I’m drowning in her / We’re both / Drowning
<|endoftext|>
sometimes late at night i post facebook statuses about how sad i am in the hopes that people will reach out to me and ask me if i'm okay and i will tell them no and they  / will ask what's wrong and i will say i'm depressed and they will say just think positive and i will call them  / stupid and i will say depression does not work that way and i will get mad and i will block them on facebook and my friend count will go down by one
<|endoftext|>
I walk home / fighting the crisp autumn air  / and make myself toast  / in an empty kitchen  / and hit my head / on an open  / cupboard  / and all I can see are stars.
<|endoftext|>
Drizzle / Midnight pine, / I sit dry
<|endoftext|>
Waiting for the Zipper / 4 PM / Sun in West clouds, gold
<|endoftext|>
I wrote a hundred songs / Before I knew your name.
<|endoftext|>
i'd never be disappointed by another tv series finale  / (never have to learn what a mortgage is) / never have to attend anyone else's funeral  / (never have to pay taxes) / never regret not making a move on the girl with the outer space leggings
<|endoftext|>
I have conversations with you / in my dreams. / Did you know that?
<|endoftext|>
The first time that I saw you, I was stuck in states of wonder  / I walked up to you seat and told you that you were a stunner / You smiled and gave a napkin and said "you should write your number" / So I took it and signed my name.
<|endoftext|>
Cool breeze maybe / just a shillyshallying snow / That'll ruin everything
<|endoftext|>
Barefoot by the sea, / stopping to scratch one ankle / With one toe
<|endoftext|>
Inside and out / And I’m hopeful / That they will make / A better mistake next time
<|endoftext|>
He leaned in and He told me  / i have the saddest eyes he’s seen  / and i pushed him away  / because i couldn’t  / make love to a  / darren
<|endoftext|>
The way she rolls her ankle / In her white high-top Converse
<|endoftext|>
David Bowie died thirteen days / after I sat next to my grandma / while she slowly did the same  / and my aunt said she wanted / Space Oddity to play at her funeral / and I could only ask: / Why not Golden Years?
<|endoftext|>
beloved Wei-shan wanted to come back as a cow grazing in a wide valley / can't you see him munching flowers idling under stars on a windy night
<|endoftext|>
He had no fear for the world was kind / Or so to him it seemed. / But as he aged, he found the truth / And saw that it would mean
<|endoftext|>
Johnny asks me  / "You know who's probably fucking great in bed?" / He answers for me, "Ava. She's a yoga instructor now."
<|endoftext|>
Sometimes I'm scared of fear because I know it's in my head  / And my head's a place of dissonance where lonely thoughts are fed / The things I do to feel alive make me wish that I were dead / I'm just a careless keeper of all the words I've never said
<|endoftext|>
Dusk boy / smashing dandelions / With a stick
<|endoftext|>
Everlastingly loose / and responsive, / The cloud business
<|endoftext|>
Four bluejays quiet / in the afternoon tree, / Occasionally scratching
<|endoftext|>
Gray day / the blue spruce / Is green
<|endoftext|>
I am the quilted, clothwork one –  / a borrowed, patched, and mixed tableau.  / I am the discovered girl;  / that's all you ever need to know.
<|endoftext|>
They say at the end of the day  / all a man ever really has is  / his word, and a woman  / her reputation, so my  / face bears the cratered terrain  / of a life's reputation earned  / brutally.
<|endoftext|>
No bay to make port  / No gull to find land  / No psiren calling towards a fitting end  / I am at sea sir, at sea.
<|endoftext|>
Wild to sit on a haypile, / Writing Haikus, / Drinkin wine
<|endoftext|>
In enormous blizzard / burying everything / My cat turned back
<|endoftext|>
Memère says: "Planets are / far apart so people / Can't bother each other."
<|endoftext|>
Water in the birdbath / a film of ice / On the moon
<|endoftext|>
Fuck a love poem
<|endoftext|>
And a God-given right / To 9mm of salvation. / Great like the annihilation of ancestral abodes / The promise of restitution / Now just pipe dreams and tears.
<|endoftext|>
October night, lights / of Connecticut towns / Across the sound
<|endoftext|>
Poor gentle flesh / there is / No answer
<|endoftext|>
You are beautiful / And I hate that I love to love you / The mere sight of you makes my heart pound / Pumping hot blood that burns through my veins
<|endoftext|>
If a giggle was worth a nickel / I couldn't finish the math
<|endoftext|>
My cat’s asleep / poor little angel, / the burden of flesh!
<|endoftext|>
I found my love in Mimir's well  / in Avalon, in Dante's Hell  / in Middle-Earth and Homer's Troy - / and still, I'm no more than a boy.
<|endoftext|>
Among the nervous birds / the morning dove / Nibbles quietly
<|endoftext|>
Taghagata [=Tathagata] neither loathes / nor loves / His body’s milk or shit
<|endoftext|>
My beds in the corner / Maybe / I can't see well
<|endoftext|>
I'd sniff you like a dog and taste you / then kiss your other mouth endlessly if I could white hair or not
<|endoftext|>
before birth after birth / that's where you are now
<|endoftext|>
that stone Buddha deserves all the birdshit it gets / I wave my skinny arms like a tall flower in the wind
<|endoftext|>
Nope / Not my problem.  / You need consciousness  / To feel  / To read all of this.
<|endoftext|>
That one day you just realize you are an adult  / And you go to work and you go to the store  / And you see all of these people despairingly disconnected  / Desolately walled off
<|endoftext|>
are you enjoying reading my poems? / i actually don't even know if they count as poems / maybe if i put in arbitrary enjambment
<|endoftext|>
Kneedeep in the / blizzard, the ancient / Misery of the cat
<|endoftext|>
The Ten Commandments / And those damn commie bastards. / Great like / The perpetual and proud roll of
<|endoftext|>
Bird suddenly quiet / on his branch – his / Wife glancing at him
<|endoftext|>
Dusk in the holy / woods / Dust on my window
<|endoftext|>
you'd reach behind your ear / to keep your wayward hair / while I would sit, bear witness / say nothing, only stare
<|endoftext|>
Reading my notes / The fly stepping from / The page to the finger
<|endoftext|>
I just...want to sleep / I use sleep to escape
<|endoftext|>
You paid yr homage / to the moon, / And she sank
<|endoftext|>
no more Zen write one great line / like a needle piercing a sore spot on your arm
<|endoftext|>
Quiet moonlit night / Neighbor boy studying / By telescope; "Ooo!"
<|endoftext|>
The new moon / is the toe nail / Of God
<|endoftext|>
has a naked boy ever slept beside you?  / two shoulder blades splayed wide as an open journal  / the trench between them littered with freckles, dandelion blackheads
<|endoftext|>
when people ask me  / with asteroids dripping / from their / pupils: / “what is your favorite constellation?”
<|endoftext|>
Some, when I meet them / will feel, with weird feelings / like parts of myself I have  / been avoiding
<|endoftext|>
Mexico – After the dim / markets, bright / San Juan Letran
<|endoftext|>
One flower / on the cliffside / Nodding at the canyon
<|endoftext|>
Birds chirp / fog / Bugs the gate
<|endoftext|>
We see each other's cars around town and. / We wave. / One day, we get new ones. / The waving stops. / Businesses / New friends / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
No rest.
<|endoftext|>
Looking for my cat / in the weeds, / I found a butterfly
<|endoftext|>
I close my eyes / I hear & see / Mandala
<|endoftext|>
You’d be surprised / how little I knew / Even up to yesterday
<|endoftext|>
The mansion of / the moon / Has hidden faces
<|endoftext|>
The clouds are / following each other / Into Eternity
<|endoftext|>
The droopy constellation / on the grassy hill / Emily Dickinson’s Tomb
<|endoftext|>
Spring night – the gleam / of the fish head eye / In the grass
<|endoftext|>
this boat is and is not / When it sinks both disappear
<|endoftext|>
Fighting over a peach / stone, bluejays / In the bushes
<|endoftext|>
Late afternoon / the mop is drying / On the rock
<|endoftext|>
“When you hold the knife  / And your mind wanders to ending your life. / When you grow accustomed to it  / That’s how you’ll know.
<|endoftext|>
into the far corners of the galaxy  / so I can join her forever / in the heavens.
<|endoftext|>
A young boy
<|endoftext|>
and i will not be depressed / i will be confident and strong and happy / i will finally live my life
<|endoftext|>
I don't own a sewing needle but I keep calligraphy / in a special box given by my dying friend
<|endoftext|>
if there's nowhere to rest at the end / how can I get lost along the way?
<|endoftext|>
I may be old but I recall the plot of your first book  / Where Mary fell in love with Henry Gimble’s Pastry Cook  / I also have a corner kept for all the art you drew  / I always liked the one you did of Howard feeling blue.
<|endoftext|>
it's logical: if you are not going anywhere / any road is the right one
<|endoftext|>
and He hugged me tight  / in the warmest grip  / and then He held  / for too long.
<|endoftext|>
religions and it was so real life / that it cant possibly leave my / mind now bc I cant make memories / like that anymore when I’m trying / so hard to make memories like that
<|endoftext|>
The beautiful red / dogwood tree / Waiting for the cross
<|endoftext|>
this is the romance sold at every corner / and thrown away by the end of the week. / am i wooing you yet? / lean in and smell the perfume
<|endoftext|>
We sit in sacred silence, a captive congregation. / Spines straight, fingers folded  / a plastic smile slashed through each manufactured visage  / nostrils upturned at the lingering stench  / blood and sex and shame.
<|endoftext|>
I'm going to die alone  / As someone's best friend.  / I'm frothing, seizing  / Right behind them
<|endoftext|>
And made me feel like I was attempting to swallow oceans / The voice that felt like medicinal syrup in my ears / “She’s gone.” / As my body becomes cymbals crashing to the floor / Waves crashing into rocks
<|endoftext|>
It thrummed inside its little jail / And buzzed and murmured too. / And twixt my fingertips, I watched / To see what it would do.
<|endoftext|>
"Me first" you wrote / As you planned in your head / You ended your life / Before chemo round two / I was thirty one years old / When I lost you / Tear it to shreds. / -som

In London-town cats / can sleep / In the butcher's doorway.
<|endoftext|>
skinny legs wandering no friends the lamppost moves not me following / my song money is power spring the cuckoo weeps blood inside me
<|endoftext|>
Hell-bent for treasures of skin  / New faces and old fetishes. / Tongue in cheek, words of mouth  / Often to leave the lips
<|endoftext|>
To smoke, to bleed, to wish, is to know the air, the heat, and the emptiness;  / To stare at neon is to know the abyss behind it.
<|endoftext|>
Let them come again in force  / To see the fallen in our eyes. / Let them cower in retreat, knowing  / That a martyr never dies.
<|endoftext|>
The stars are racing / real fast / Through the clouds
<|endoftext|>
or that time you wanted to hang out  / and i missed doing college applications for you / or that time i wanted to talk  / and you were too busy being you  / or those times i needed a friend
<|endoftext|>
Holding up my purring / cat to the moon, / I sighed
<|endoftext|>
For there is no time. / No calm. / No peace.
<|endoftext|>
Forgotten history to us is the struggle to / capture the American Dream.
<|endoftext|>
We don't talk anymore / when I'm awake. / But you already knew that.
<|endoftext|>
November the seventh / The last / Faint cricket
<|endoftext|>
One of us will call every week or so. / Intending to get together. / We're busier now. / Demanding workloads. / New friends. / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
melons eggplants rice rivers the sky / I offer them to you on this holiday
<|endoftext|>
Seven birds in a tree, / looking / In every direction
<|endoftext|>
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief. / My assumption of the child’s health turned out to be quite brief. / Her condition cut the odds[of a successful birth] percent-wise down to twenty  / But twenty’s really not so bad – like two flips of a penny.
<|endoftext|>
If you can take five weeks off me  / maybe take a little more  / because when I was here five weeks ago / there was no blood on Highway Four.
<|endoftext|>
she painted abstracts on her shower curtain / with hair / that fell out as she washed  / and left them there for visitors to cringe from.
<|endoftext|>
Spring night / the silence / Of the stars
<|endoftext|>
Don’t sleep with a poet. / She’ll turn your thighs into couplets, The way they wrap around her like twin vines. / spiraling up a brick wall.
<|endoftext|>
Wind too strong / empty nest / At midnight
<|endoftext|>
I never worried  / about the Sun in Sacramento  / I knew it was there  / and somehow knew / it would always  / be waiting / if I ever came back.
<|endoftext|>
and then there was flore and cathy and hannah and Jessica  / oh, how I loved Jessica  / She was rainbows and sunshine  / She read yeats and keats and all that
<|endoftext|>
Trying to study sutras, / the kitten on my page / Demanding affection
<|endoftext|>
And people  / will be there too. / After twenty years I hear  / how I talk  / when I hear them. / The subtle inflection  / feels like a key
<|endoftext|>
rippling with tides of time  / the arcs of planet’s rings / slicing / into the void like the windswept sails / of the ships of our souls  / the seafoam starlight
<|endoftext|>
Leaf dropping straight / In the windless midnight: / The dream of change
<|endoftext|>
Nibbling his ankle, / the mule’s teeth / Like kettle drum
<|endoftext|>
Seven line love poem: / And suddenly the steering wheel jolted / echos of twisted metal and engine failure / flare as the vehicle gyrates across lanes / It takes moments, and then minutes, and then days / to realize what I've done. Sitting at the side of the road / waiting for the cops. Eighteen days since you last called / the greatest thing I ever had lay wrecked.
<|endoftext|>
passion's red thread is infinite / like the earth always under me
<|endoftext|>
no nothing only those wintry crows / bright black in the sun
<|endoftext|>
Yellow halfmoon cradled / among the horizontal boards / Of my fence
<|endoftext|>
All the wash / on the line / Advanced one foot
<|endoftext|>
Does anyone else feel like their ex was holding everything together?
<|endoftext|>
Chipmunk went in / butterfly / Came out
<|endoftext|>
every day i tell myself this / and every day i am disappointed  / i am such a fucking liar / 
<|endoftext|>
Neons, Chinese restaurants / coming on / Girls come by shades
<|endoftext|>
Via proviso and prominence  / videotape the effervescent spheres' / kismet as they ski / upwards like fractured dagger tips / to compose a paved entryway / atop the crest of the Raduga K-8.
<|endoftext|>
Playing basketball / the lady next door / Watching again
<|endoftext|>
Someday is not today, tomorrow, or the day after that / Someday, should it exist, is when we have settled comfortably into our lives and our arms are home to different people / When there are too many things standing in the way of us acting on our whims / When declarations of former non-platonic love can do no harm
<|endoftext|>
Walking down the road with dog / a crushed leaf
<|endoftext|>
One drop from / the blue spruce / two more drops
<|endoftext|>
Here comes / My dragon / goodbye!
<|endoftext|>
she had freckles on her left shoulder but / never on her right and a / small tattoo on her ankle done (badly) / by a friend on a whim.
<|endoftext|>
Roll over / Chapped lips / Fuck this
<|endoftext|>
why so many bobby pins  / have you considered vacuuming  / whose clothes are these in the drawer  / why do you have an iphone cable  / do you think that bench still has your initials on it
<|endoftext|>
Now we reach for what to say  / When the silence is too strong. / But nothing seems to reach. / Forever is too long.
<|endoftext|>
A bird on / the branch out there / I waved
<|endoftext|>
How that butterfly’ll wake up / When someone / Bongs that bell!
<|endoftext|>
Grass waves, / hens chuckle, / Nothing’s happening
<|endoftext|>
you stand inside me naked infinite love / the dawn bell rips my dreaming heart
<|endoftext|>
The falling snow / The hissing radiators / The bride out there
<|endoftext|>
And this  / my untethered existence  / drifts on  / at a snail's pace  / on a swallow's back.
<|endoftext|>
even before trees rocks I was nothing / when I'm dead nowhere I'll be nothing
<|endoftext|>
Who are you letting / Fuck you until you bruise? / When was the last time / You called home?
<|endoftext|>
That's it. I give up.
<|endoftext|>
i checked again—the lump's still there  / (a manly way to go) / can men even get breast cancer?  / (why are you grabbing your manboob in the first place?) / i was soaping it in the shower
<|endoftext|>
and write about things I often forget / like the fact that smoke tastes good / and e-cigs provide no warmth.
<|endoftext|>
Immediat'ly the world bled grey / And goosebumps pricked my skin. / Each breath, an icecube in my lungs / Despite the glow within.
<|endoftext|>
Okay, no bed... / I feel warm fingers / Of copper carpet  / Massaging my bare breasts
<|endoftext|>
Staring at each other, / Squirrel in the branch, / Cat in the grass
<|endoftext|>
I’m so mad / I could bite / The montaintops
<|endoftext|>
and under starlit skies / between swaying reeds / i wait
<|endoftext|>
I cannot bear the thought of breaking  / Losing hope I grab the rope but now my hands wont stop their shaking.
<|endoftext|>
She told me that all bad people are just good people on a strange path  / and all the saints are just secret keeping sinners, or mediocre folks / who never woke up on the odd side of the road: / Exceptional Evil is only the bedfellow of Ghandian Greatness. / I told her the saints had been such selfish lovers lately. / She said, you’ve got two hands  / do it yourself.
<|endoftext|>
my monk friend has a wierd endearing habit / he weaves sandals and leaves them secretly by the roadside
<|endoftext|>
A little later I poured  / a drink  / but then I remembered I sobered up  / a couple months  / ago
<|endoftext|>
Big wall of clouds / from the North / Coming in – brrrr!
<|endoftext|>
clouds endless clouds climbing beyond / ask nothing from words on a page
<|endoftext|>
why didn't you write more  / did she ever read any of your poems  / did you show her any  / when did you realize you could only sing along to the chorus
<|endoftext|>
A million acres / of Bo-trees / And not one Buddha
<|endoftext|>
Rinzai did it without a care / no clouds wind sky a heart that simply sings
<|endoftext|>
Fuck a love poem / It's easy to do when you're enamored
<|endoftext|>
The red paper / waves for the breeze / the breeze
<|endoftext|>
this cow has come to teach you: what you do is where you are / where you are is what you do: nobody knows which monk I was
<|endoftext|>
there is this little man in my chest cavity / he is wearing a little hardhat and has little workboots on / in his left hand he holds a little pickaxe  / his job is really simple
<|endoftext|>
ten dumb years I wanted things to be different furious proud I still feel it / one summer midnight in my little boat on Lake Biwa caaaawwweeeee / father when I was a boy you left us now I forgive you
<|endoftext|>
She slept enveloped / inside my arms / like a letter  / and like any grand secret / I wanted nothing more
<|endoftext|>
Aurora borealis / over Mount Hozomeen / The world is eternal
<|endoftext|>
“Are you asleep?” / “No” / “Did I pass out?” / “Yes” / “Are you ok?” / “Yes” / “I’m sorry” / I’m not sorry / “It’s fine” / It’s not
<|endoftext|>
the constellation of tears / welling up inside the corners / of my tiny smile  / kidnap me from my tiny corner of the world  / and drop me onto the arms of spirals
<|endoftext|>
thighs oh my god they kick  / up like untamed horses and my hand is  / moving on its own like it has a separate  / brain and i wish we could switch brains so i
<|endoftext|>
It's grainy
<|endoftext|>
I love bamboo how it looks / and because men carve it into flutes
<|endoftext|>
White clouds of this steamy planet / obstruct / My vision of the blue void
<|endoftext|>
Alpine fir with / snowcap’t backround – / It doesn’t matter
<|endoftext|>
Who wd have guessed / that a January moon / could be so orange!
<|endoftext|>
I walked through the door of death came back went back am here / brisk wind warm rain dawn the bleached moon
<|endoftext|>
A girl much younger than I came up to me and asked  / "Why do you look so sad?" / I forget my response, but it was something witty and she laughed. / I had sex with her that night  / And then never talked to her again.
<|endoftext|>
"Watch where you're going, you just almost ran over that / Mexican lady and made me spill your... quinoa... you faggot." / I nod. / I miss the turn a minute later.
<|endoftext|>
So humid you cant / light matches, like / Living in a tank
<|endoftext|>
Walking along the night beach, / Military music / On the boulevard. 
<|endoftext|>
The little sparrow / on my eave drainpipe / Is looking around
<|endoftext|>
Groaning fingers stretch out  / striving to reach obsolescence in the / form of a landline home phone.
<|endoftext|>
Temple trees / across the creek / Fog blowing
<|endoftext|>
Reflected upsidedown / in the sunset lake, pines, / Pointing to infinity
<|endoftext|>
For though I have long drowned  / my eyes and ears have fallen  / on such creatures and sounds  / of intrigue and and color; blues and browns.
<|endoftext|>
I think my girlfriend is getting sick of my shit.
<|endoftext|>
Someday, I'll talk in detail / Of how, for a while, you were my home / I'll let you in on how the thought of spending the rest of my life with you seemed—for a moment—blissful
<|endoftext|>
Writing constantly back and forth  / back and forth  / Back and forth.  / Sending their poetry onto the world / Instantaneously, At the tapping of a screen.
<|endoftext|>
today I finally told her  / in rain-padded silence we walked to my apartment  / murky New York sky a black shelter above us / void of stars, filled with lights
<|endoftext|>
In back of the Supermarket, / in the parking lot weeds, / Purple flowers
<|endoftext|>
Dawn – the writer who / hasn’t shaved, / Poring over notebooks
<|endoftext|>
Hollow rhymes you write for sport in / empty lines for school report. Fa- / cade is crumbling I can't do this.  / Sorrow's humbling- won't get through this
<|endoftext|>
forget what the masters wrote truth's a razor / each instant sitting here you and I being here
<|endoftext|>
These thoughts slither around in my brain like a snake / Eating away at my will to get through each day / Eating away any thoughts of resolution / My mind is polluted / Like the air in my city
<|endoftext|>
An emptiness sat at the table beside him / Silently calling his name / A hole in the shape of a red-headed woman / Who Jesus had taken away
<|endoftext|>
After the earthquake, / A child crying / In the silence
<|endoftext|>
Unwell is an understatment. / Not quite such, the likes of this. / No cures yet, no medicines / For this specific ailment.
<|endoftext|>
Surprising cat fight / in the parlor on a / Blustery September night
<|endoftext|>
Vigorous Springfields / Speak their stories of sorrow. / They tell of martyrs they've made / In the past, present, and tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
Fiddlydee! / Another day, / Another something-or-other!
<|endoftext|>
But then I wake up / and here I am, and there you are. / Not here, but there.
<|endoftext|>
so many words about it / the only language is you don't open your lips
<|endoftext|>
All day long wearing / a hat that wasn't / On my head
<|endoftext|>
The racket of the starlings / in the trees / My cat’s back
<|endoftext|>
Sometimes / I can’t tear my eyes away / from the razor in the medicine cabinet / and all I can see is crimson running down my ankles / and pooling on the bathroom tile / until I force myself to remember / that it’s not an option anymore
<|endoftext|>
or “the dark pit or remembrance” / pretty deep stuff, I know. / Last night I was up late
<|endoftext|>
poems should come from bare ground / night falling on night falling on a black landscape
<|endoftext|>
those old koans meaningless just ways of faking virtue / this gorgeous young whore wears silk robes that hang open about an inch
<|endoftext|>
I have literally zero friends and feel like no one is going to love me. / I'm afraid to make friends because they will find out i have no friends.
<|endoftext|>
"The wind agrees with me / not the sun" / Washlines
<|endoftext|>
The ant struggles escaping / from the web / The spider’s non-comment
<|endoftext|>
Protected by the clouds, / the moon / Sleeps sailing
<|endoftext|>
Highest perfect fool / the wisdom / Of the two-legged rat
<|endoftext|>
Useless! useless! / heavy rain driving / Into the sea
<|endoftext|>
Step gingerly, one foot at a time  / out of the shower-bath and wrap  / a lone giant fluffy pink towel  / around myself. Steam drifts slowly  / from my body like 8 grams of soul  / departing.
<|endoftext|>
whilst wading my inner sanctum  / silver glisten of a hooked dream  / there’s a whale to redeem
<|endoftext|>
The night / is red / with stars
<|endoftext|>
Praying all the time / talking / To myself
<|endoftext|>
amazingly sad how its blade mirrors the years / how sadness extends far as the hills and rivers
<|endoftext|>
"This is the worst ginger ale I've had in my life" / I said to the white walls and fluorescent lights / A record-setting breakdown, achieving the impossible / Shooting for the moon and landing in the hospital -
<|endoftext|>
The shame / of wanting to fuck the therapist, because sex / is the only thing that makes me feel anymore
<|endoftext|>
Every cat in Kyoto / can see through the fog
<|endoftext|>
up all night in this fisherman’s hut drinking talking / his wife hates me bangs her spoon on the kettle
<|endoftext|>
Love is a momentary thing. / I’d rather spend a moment / whispering through cupped hands  / than an eternity / remembering a long forgotten dance.
<|endoftext|>
To a drive and desire  / for things so true; / Compassion and love  / I feel for you - / All.
<|endoftext|>
and our fingers grasped  / at the pieces of ourselves  / that were deeper than faces.  / But it was only me  / as she whispered
<|endoftext|>
I didn't see one thing on my trip / but I breathed and whatever I breathed was time
<|endoftext|>
i picked flowers from her backyard / and she pressed them in her library books. / her eyes told me the flowers / were better off with her
<|endoftext|>
we cut class like the valentines we made in first grade  / decisive but clumsy, eager to learn, and with emotion / spray paint in place of quills, so we can transcribe our novellas / on a broke city's tunnels and halls
<|endoftext|>
Run over my lawnmower, / waiting for me to leave, / The frog
<|endoftext|>
my death? who was it anyway always where he was never / no not once ever seeing himself an eyeball speaks
<|endoftext|>
Me, my pipe, / my folded legs / Far from Buddha
<|endoftext|>
Lonely brickwalls in Detroit / Sunday afternoon / piss call
<|endoftext|>
I’ll be buried as the Byzantines
<|endoftext|>
she’d play with it almost anywhere day and night / touch it with the deepest part of herself
<|endoftext|>
and i held you in my arms one last time / tears streaming down our faces / and i cursed God / and i cursed myself
<|endoftext|>
this donkey stumbles blind over stones into walls, ditches / no words for grief or joy no words for his ruined heart
<|endoftext|>
My Japanese blinds / are down / I’m reading about Ethiopia
<|endoftext|>
Cloudy autumn nite / cold water drips / in the sink.
<|endoftext|>
"Stop," / licked my cheek / to my ear  / finishing
<|endoftext|>
I'll miss what you were  / not what you are / Because now I know  / There is darkness / Within every star
<|endoftext|>
You’ve forgotten how to make love under the open sky.
<|endoftext|>
A full November moon / and mild, / Mary Carney
<|endoftext|>
a woman is enlightenment when you're with her and the red thread / of both your passions flare inside you and you see
<|endoftext|>
you'd yawn and curl your toes  / glance to your glaring phone / and in my room, standing there / I'd know who was alone.
<|endoftext|>
And life  / this life  / from its turbid view  / through blemished glass -
<|endoftext|>
Accounts of the morose  / Notches of shallow victories  / Revelations made in oppressive solemnity  / Fruitless victories against nameless foes.
<|endoftext|>
Caramel / Honey / Heroin
<|endoftext|>
Frogs don’t care / just sit there / Brooding on the moon
<|endoftext|>
and I have yet to come to terms with it / you are still at my side / arms splayed out at an awkward angle / head tilted unnaturally to the side
<|endoftext|>
Two ants hurry / to catch up / With lonely Joe
<|endoftext|>
Thoughts of you wrap my mind / Slowly constricting it, leaving it to suffocate / You are perfect, because you are you
<|endoftext|>
she bit her lip. "i haven't," she lied / and left through the fire exit.
<|endoftext|>
sometimes all I am is dark emptiness / I can't hide in the sleeves of my own robes
<|endoftext|>
And I asked her for one more.  / She bled  / "All you write about are girls. / You never write about me.
<|endoftext|>
It's been years. / We see each other at the store. / One of us is just back to visit parents / They're getting older / Sometimes they ask about you. / How old is the baby? / Seven. We're headed to see their / New friends / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
this soul torch I hold up lights the sky / think of those nights freezing staring into the river
<|endoftext|>
Subconscious me did all it could to keep us two as one. / Mistakenly mistimed the pulling out when I was done. / “Oh, shit,” we said together, but we knew it was okay. / The little tube inside her arm / would keep babies away.
<|endoftext|>
Full moon in the trees / across the street, / the jail
<|endoftext|>
Hot coffee / and a cigarette – / why zazen?
<|endoftext|>
You died today  / And I don't know what to say. / Your phone still works, I called it today / I watched your phone vibrate on your night table  / I saw the picture of me you would see every time I called you.
<|endoftext|>
Washing my face / with snow / Beneath the Little Dipper
<|endoftext|>
sick all I can think of is love and fucking the love song / hums in my groin listen my hair’s white wild grasses uncut on my meadow
<|endoftext|>
Autumn night / low moon / Fire in Smithtown
<|endoftext|>
two in the morning
<|endoftext|>
Worm is looking / at the moon, / Waiting for me
<|endoftext|>
"Thank you for Emma Watson. Heart eye emoji.. / ..And for baconators. Two heart eye emojis" / See, if I had God's phone number, he'd probably block me / Because I'd ask him things like
<|endoftext|>
"Too many men look at me / and see what they want to. / They look at me and see  / broken picture frames  / that they can repair  / and put our faces into."  / Our hands met
<|endoftext|>
Spring day / in my mind / Nothing
<|endoftext|>
Hsu-T'ang tore off his robes like a broken sandal / Zen has no center clouds rake the moon some voice claws at my heart
<|endoftext|>
The poppies! / I could die / In delicacy now
<|endoftext|>
But I am just a mirror to the sun / Reflecting majesty that comes from you. / If they seek virtues in me, I have none / For in my heart, I know this much is true: / I never knew how perfect I could be / Until you came and gave the best to me.
<|endoftext|>
The rush that you provide is always knocking at my door. / You batter and demean me, but I find I'm craving more. / My sanctuary now is the opaqueness of my mind. / I'll leave you when I need to, but for now I'm doing fine.
<|endoftext|>
A long island / in the sky / The Milky Way
<|endoftext|>
so burning’s knowing and I’m not even drunk on three wines / plunge into the fire reality pure endless pain
<|endoftext|>
yes, we all have limits / it’s not something we can fix. / but remember: / even the most beautiful poems / are just recycled old tricks  / only combinations of letters / plucked from the same limited tree / of 26.
<|endoftext|>
Horse waving his tail / in a field of clover / At sundown
<|endoftext|>
I hate it I know it's nothing but I / suck out the world's sweet juicy plum
<|endoftext|>
Sunday / the sky is blue, / The flowers are red
<|endoftext|>
she had a couple of lovers / who took shifts licking her downy / cunt and soft belly with a slight snail trail / that faded at the belly button.
<|endoftext|>
Ooh! they kicked up / a cloud of dust! / The birds in my yard
<|endoftext|>
Guys! / Shut up! / Ok, got it." / We said  / "We'll be there in  / like  / fifteen minutes."
<|endoftext|>
The low yellow / moon above / The quiet lamplit house
<|endoftext|>
All that ocean of blue / soon as those clouds / Pass away
<|endoftext|>
Someday, we will sit intimately as old friends do / Exchange pleasantries and engage in a little playful arguing as we have always done / And when I'm sure all other stories have been told, I will ask you if you have time for one more
<|endoftext|>
Mists blew by, I / Closed my eyes, / Stove did the talking
<|endoftext|>
She looked at me and said  / "You should fuck me / before you love me." / And so I did.
<|endoftext|>
How sad it must be, to be one less than infinity / Knowing that you are so close, yet so far from free / By leaps and bounds, striving towards the impossible / Knowing that your chances are simply improbable / How sad it must be, to be one less than infinity
<|endoftext|>
some monks live in caves build huts on snowy mountains / right now clouds flee across the moon my heart
<|endoftext|>
flute notes bring gods demons only that music / again the world's biggest ass-man hasn't one friend / his loneliness that music
<|endoftext|>
Three in the morning? / Where do you go / When you get stir- / crazy?
<|endoftext|>
the shifting truths and kaleidoscope fears inside his soul  / do you coax them out with a warm, empathic coo  / and as you have seen him, has he seen you?
<|endoftext|>
I found my love in orchards wide  / in emerald hearts, in blushing bride  / in phoenix down and warrens deep - / that which I know, I dare not keep.
<|endoftext|>
But everyone keeps saying you have a plan / If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him what that "plan" was / Because I hear a lot of people talking about it
<|endoftext|>
My mother has cancer, I just lost my best friend, my grades are slipping and I still haven't felt a single thing.
<|endoftext|>
She’s still here  / She bought me beer / Bruised shin; shattered ego / She made me do it
<|endoftext|>
The same old question from the barber  / "How long since you cut your hair?" / I was here five weeks ago / but sat in a different chair.
<|endoftext|>
and lots of pointless sensory descriptions / about trees / then i will be a real poet / i will buy a beret
<|endoftext|>
I have a heart to collect  / It's been out on the streets  / thumped by the goose-stepped feet / marching along to my pet peeved beat.
<|endoftext|>
Sunny day – bird tracks / & cat tracks / In the snow
<|endoftext|>
Count the hairs trapped between the  / tines. Three, four, five. No, six. More  / than yesterday. Pop three pills in  / my grimace and hope for the best.  / Maybe there will be fewer  / tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
on the deep green lily pad dew / has no color of its own
<|endoftext|>
like coins / inside their pockets / that is creepy / instead / a real quarter
<|endoftext|>
Snow on the grape / arbor – the little / dead raisins
<|endoftext|>
I  / the lonely soul / Write alone.
<|endoftext|>
why is it all so beautiful this fake dream / this craziness why?
<|endoftext|>
We're together, it's euphoric, a sensation that I love. / A needle sent down to my arm from Heaven up above. / The lows seem unimportant when I'm riding out the highs. / We're together, it's euphoric, I lean back and close me eyes.
<|endoftext|>
“The things in my head don’t make sense”  / has he ever laid his forehead into the puzzle piece groove of your chest  / has he let it out, quietly or like the clouds
<|endoftext|>
I like my anger my grouchy furious love / amazing how we say such nice things about the dead
<|endoftext|>
The cat: a little / body being used / By a little person
<|endoftext|>
I saw her five minutes before, carefully studying the ingredients of her seaweed salad. / I'm rooting for her to make  / But she glances back at me with a look / That tells me she won't.
<|endoftext|>
These days  / there seems to be  / an overpowering / oddness of being / overtaking me.
<|endoftext|>
The people all flock as the gypsy cart rocks / And approaches the town from afar  / And they dance to his song as he rolls right along / To the beat of his Spanish Guitar.
<|endoftext|>
Debris on the lake / my soul / Is upset
<|endoftext|>
He gets it.
<|endoftext|>
Sadness / Longing / Ache, and hurt / Have driven me to love  / And given birth
<|endoftext|>
The mountains / are mighty patient, / Buddha-man
<|endoftext|>
And I  / The boyfriend  / Write this poem.
<|endoftext|>
Epiphanies lasting no longer than a day / False hope that I have found my escape / I once cried out for someone to save me / Now I simply call out for sympathy / Instead of being made to feel bad / For feeling bad
<|endoftext|>
We introduce our new friends and lovers, looking for approval. / The introductions stop. / We hug when we see each other.
<|endoftext|>
Wet fog / shining / In lamplit leaves
<|endoftext|>
there are times / late at night / when people ask me  / with asteroids dripping
<|endoftext|>
Wooden house / raw gray / Pink light in the window
<|endoftext|>
He is beautiful  / and as I trace his skin  / with my fingers  / I feel a little more at home  / more than I have in a long time.
<|endoftext|>
frogs at the bottom of a well like you idiot / thrashing in mud laughable so very very right
<|endoftext|>
sick Zen from the famous three you know who I mean / I can change your life with a mere look
<|endoftext|>
Snap your finger / stop the world! / Rain falls harder
<|endoftext|>
the crow's caw was ok but one night with a lovely whore / opened a wisdom deeper than what that bird said
<|endoftext|>
I try to be a god man but all that comes / of trying is I feel more guilty
<|endoftext|>
For brevity’s sake, I’m doing okay. / You may have noticed there  / that pause that I placed  / so you might be aware / that I’m desperately struggling / to surface for air  / and failing in the worst kind of way.
<|endoftext|>
Gaudy / Supplicating / An elf surely
<|endoftext|>
How’d those guys / get in here, / those two flies?
<|endoftext|>
Remember when I put a stop to this? / My conscience betrayed my needs. / I broke off whatever you want to call this / and for the first time in a long time I felt guilt / I guess there was too much guilt / Because I hated that / You were still hers.
<|endoftext|>
A shade off from perfectly matching the ones under her eyes. / She's bald, you can tell even though she wears a cap  / Chalk-white and half-dead  / Rail thin  / Weak - you can just tell.
<|endoftext|>
that star / is waving & flaming / Something awful
<|endoftext|>
Summer night / I put out / The empty milk bottle
<|endoftext|>
Red roses, white / clouds, blue sky, / In my birdbath
<|endoftext|>
My Christ blinds / are down / I’m reading about Virgin
<|endoftext|>
Finally got round to getting some psychiatric support. Hope it helps. / I'm slipping back again and there is nothing / I can do about it.
<|endoftext|>
icy window windy snow moon tangled among black flowers / the mind is water wrapping itself where it is around what what what / never the same
<|endoftext|>
Two Japanese boys / singing / Inky Dinky Parly Voo
<|endoftext|>
America: fishing licenses / the license / To meditate
<|endoftext|>
Late autumn nite / the last faint cricket.
<|endoftext|>
Get to go / fork a hoss / And head for Mexico
<|endoftext|>
But when the honeymoon ends / and the mask falls off / It's much more difficult / to do more than scoff / Because after eleven months / when you gave it your all / you're told to fuck off / and find out you were nothing / but a glorified booty call
<|endoftext|>
Once her heart switches its beat  / everything you once did as a treat  / now are things that made you a creep
<|endoftext|>
Those birds sitting / out there on the fence / They're all going to die.
<|endoftext|>
The sound of silence / is all the instruction / You’ll get
<|endoftext|>
cheap tea thin gruel pale leaves as winter begins / this threadbare robe feels fine in the first dawn frost
<|endoftext|>
do you remember the time / we got lost in a rainstorm / and my shoes got so soggy / i threw them away and bought new ones
<|endoftext|>
i'm watching scooby-doo at four in the morning and / wondering where my life went wrong but / oh my god is that velma good lord i never / noticed how fucking joocy she is like those
<|endoftext|>
Looking at me  / she ran her fingers  / down her hips  / across scars  / and said
<|endoftext|>
I take a pen and a leather bound book  / pour a glass of fine bourbon  / buy a pack of the strongest cigarettes
<|endoftext|>
On Starvation Ridge / little sticks / Are trying to grow
<|endoftext|>
November’s New Haven / baggagemaster stiffly / Disregards my glance
<|endoftext|>
Because I've had his number for a while now / And I've sent all of those messages / I think God might be out of service / So I sent him one more message saying "I don't think I believe in you anymore"
<|endoftext|>
Girl trapped beneath the / steering wheel, beautiful / As the Dalai Lama’s dream
<|endoftext|>
Dependent and lovesick  / Strung out on a quick fix. / These ideals keep us lifted  / In a smoke cloud, persistent. / Fucking with the same shit;
<|endoftext|>
(there's still life in that flabby sack of flesh) / okay, google, can men get breast cancer?  / (the nsa is laughing at you) / sounds like it's rare  / (i'm laughing at you)
<|endoftext|>
We are in the ocean now  / Maya. / Can you see the deep? / Can you see the bottom?
<|endoftext|>
I hate the ecstasy / Of that rose, / That hairy rose
<|endoftext|>
you poor sad thing thinking death is real / all by itself
<|endoftext|>
What could be newer? this / new little bird / Not yet summer fat!
<|endoftext|>
October wind crosses the world / in this field moist grass bends to itself and to the sea
<|endoftext|>
so I lit a smoke  / I poured a drink  / and that was that.
<|endoftext|>
Remember when you threw yourself at me?  / The animal in my guts roared.  / We broke through the door to my bedroom  / and for the first time in a long time I felt passion  / I guess there was too much passion  / Because I forgot to ask if  / You were still hers.
<|endoftext|>
Nightfall, / boy smashing dandelions / with a stick
<|endoftext|>
Indeed there's no end.  / That's the trick of the maze.  / It seems we've been lied to  / By the stories and plays.
<|endoftext|>
Rub eyes / Deep breath – “Ouch!” / Fuck / New bruise / “Fuck”
<|endoftext|>
something in us always wants to cry out / someone we love knows hears
<|endoftext|>
turn the sink on high so the sound of the water can drown out the splashing sounds of your shit logs as they fall from your asshole and you can hide what you are doing even  / though shitting is a natural part of life and everyone does it even people like ellen page who are literally too cute to live yet somehow live anyway and your brain rationalizes this information but your hands are still sweaty after you  / wash them because you know your friend knows you were just ejecting shit from your asshole and in a way they are empowered by that knowledge and this makes you feel dirty/kind of broken
<|endoftext|>
Kill me- don't you even try to / kill me as i spew each lie. Just / leave me here to wallow sad-ly / while I line syllables up badly.
<|endoftext|>
Gary gone from the shack / like smoke / My lonely shoes
<|endoftext|>
Empty baseball field / A robin, / Hops along the bench
<|endoftext|>
Old man dying in a room / Groan / At five o’clock
<|endoftext|>
But then somehwere down the line / My mind ignored the clues
<|endoftext|>
pleasure pain are equal in a clear heart / no mountain hides the moon
<|endoftext|>
Churchbells ringing in town / The caterpillar / In the grass
<|endoftext|>
We talked one night that weekend and together made a plan  / To somehow get through college, all while doing all we can  / To cultivate the little one; we’d get some counsel, too. / This babe would be our passion – reason for the things we do.
<|endoftext|>
Holy sleep / Hanshan / Was right
<|endoftext|>
The other man, just as / lonesome as I am / In this empty universe
<|endoftext|>
I’m back here in the middle / of nowhere / At least I think so
<|endoftext|>
Never stopping for revision  / No contemplating  / Or indecision
<|endoftext|>
What is a rainbow, / Lord? – a hoop / For the lowly
<|endoftext|>
Am I actually depressed? / I was never depressed until now.
<|endoftext|>
Voices of critics / in the theater lobby / A moth on the carpet
<|endoftext|>
even if Buddha himself kneeled at my deathbed / he wouldn't be worth shit
<|endoftext|>
Drunken deterioration / ho-hum, / Shooting star
<|endoftext|>
If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him "do you even believe in us?" / Because maybe there's a reason we aren't feeling your love / Y'know, I'm starting to think the rainbows you put above our heads are just empty promises
<|endoftext|>
The moon is white / the lamps are / Yellow
<|endoftext|>
If I had God's phone number I'd send him things like / "Thank you for making sure I didn't die in my sleep" or / "Did you make it so that humans couldn't fly for a reason or were you just being a jerk?"
<|endoftext|>
Dry blood sat on her inner lips / as she kissed me good morning.  / Her voice softly cooed  / "I hope that isn't the last time  / I kiss you."
<|endoftext|>
Second thundershower / over – the sun / Is still high
<|endoftext|>
Sometimes they sleep / with their lights on, / the June bugs
<|endoftext|>
Missing a kick / at the icebox door / It closed anyway
<|endoftext|>
He stood along the shore and said / I do not miss my home / I do not miss my static life / I know I'm built to roam.
<|endoftext|>
break open the cherry tree where's the flower? / but spring
<|endoftext|>
So we sat there / in silence / basking / in our own intellect and sophistication / saying not a single word / so as to not disillusion ourselves.
<|endoftext|>
I've burnt all the holy pages I used to carry / but poems flare in my heart
<|endoftext|>
The light grows nearer  / Steadily they fade  / I begin to see clearer  / Goodbye, should I say?
<|endoftext|>
Sixty sunsets have I seen / revolve on this perpendicular hill
<|endoftext|>
if i bring you a dozen roses  / will you call me an inspiration? / or would you prefer a handwritten letter  / the kind that rhymes / at the end of all the lines
<|endoftext|>
needy texts / empty sex.
<|endoftext|>
Write more please, but say less too; there's / more to say, but not from you. Press / that ballpoint 'til it bleeds for- / saken thoughts and worldly needs.
<|endoftext|>
The girls that spiral into my life / Come with little invitation / More like, with no invitation / They find me, part the curtains and enter
<|endoftext|>
Geronimo, in Autumn / says no to peaceful / Cochise Smoke rises
<|endoftext|>
so many paths go up from the foothills / but one moon grazes the peak
<|endoftext|>
and is having lots of crab sex / and is getting drunk at crab parties / and has started filling out his crab fafsa application / even though it's only july
<|endoftext|>
How do you find love  / And survive the maze? / For love is complex  / And leads many ways.
<|endoftext|>
like the Red Sea / and erased their white masses / with the edges of my thumbs  / careful not to nudge her / from the grasps of sleep. / I wanted to share her beauty
<|endoftext|>
some die meditating some on their feet but he did both / not black not white that old man P’u-K’o / like a distant bird barely audible
<|endoftext|>
I put aside a tiny space for how food made me feel  / the taste, the scent, the honesty of hearty home-cooked meals. / I can’t forget the way you used to dance around and bake  / And every year without a word, we’d have my favourite cake.
<|endoftext|>
I picked up every penny, both for luck and fiscal wealth. / I’ve not believed in years, but prayed and pleaded for its health. / Then she and I talked more – before and then felt quite the same.
<|endoftext|>
After the shower, / among the drenched roses, / the bird thrashing in the bath
<|endoftext|>
I know there are trees  / cause I've been before  / and remember / the river / and floating cotton in the air.
<|endoftext|>
Arms folded / to the moon, / Among the cows
<|endoftext|>
Dawn – the tomcat / hurrying home / With his tail down
<|endoftext|>
Hummingbird hums / hello – bugs / Race and swoop
<|endoftext|>
I'm like wind pouring down hills into the city / whatever I do is beyond whatever's been done
<|endoftext|>
Summer night / the kitten playing / With the Zen calendar
<|endoftext|>
Men and women / Yakking beneath / the eternal Void
<|endoftext|>
Windows rattling / in the wind / I’m a lousy lover
<|endoftext|>
We went to the bar later that night. / Johnny killed it with every girl he talked to. / It was really an amazing thing to watch. / I sat on my stool and barely blinked as the whiskey seemed to refill itself.
<|endoftext|>
I cannot hold it together anymore. / I've never felt this depressed ever. / The worst I've ever felt. / Perhaps it's time for something drastic.
<|endoftext|>
one pause between each crow's / reckless shriek this person this person this person
<|endoftext|>
and each swirled ‘y’ mimics the curls / of my imaginary lover’s hair (poetic license  / you see, because sex still sells.) dear  / this reads like bleeding desire and burning longing / and passing a kidney stone because
<|endoftext|>
My phone is dead / My ass is stuck to the seat / Hands and feet fell asleep / Pins and needles, pins and needles
<|endoftext|>
Poetry lets me pretend these / awful thoughts are not the end. These  / inklines smeared on reader's heel- these / futile treks won't make You feel.
<|endoftext|>
smoke / milky incandescent nebulas / breathed by dusty lungs. / but the black in between— / it is time / love / possibility
<|endoftext|>
and his new truck / no / you never saw me at all / this is why i like coins / they are small / small enough to hold
<|endoftext|>
dusted the platter / i set a new table  / comfortably / for myself inside of my head
<|endoftext|>
sin like a madman until you can't do anything else / no room for any more
<|endoftext|>
I don’t know why you always do this
<|endoftext|>
When came the time to leave again / I bade the lovely fox remain  / For my path led through the unknown / A journey safest made alone  / I could not bear her come to harm; / So stood the fox and I.
<|endoftext|>
The cat musing / along the ground / cold gray day
<|endoftext|>
Drinking wine / the Queen of Greece / on a postage stamp
<|endoftext|>
with the Universe / to take her by the hand / and out of the atmosphere  / to drift by the pale blue dot / we called home and wave  / to refuge on the outskirts of Pluto  / and swing on the rings of Saturn. / So I lifted the glasses
<|endoftext|>
I have not heard from her now / For years on end
<|endoftext|>
He’s fought for so long / His defenses are gone / And he can’t fight alone anymore
<|endoftext|>
So I go to sleep. / And here you are. / And here I am.
<|endoftext|>
The flowers don’t seem / to mind / the stupid May sunshine
<|endoftext|>
nobody told the flowers to come up nobody / will ask them to leave when spring’s gone
<|endoftext|>
It’s nice to forget.  / Rain and night remind me too much  / So I come here, to columns of filmy light  / Countertops covered in wet lymph  / And people who look like ashtrays
<|endoftext|>
Closing the book, / rubbing my eyes / The sleepy August dawn
<|endoftext|>
no walls no roof no anything my house / doesn't get wet doesn't get blown down
<|endoftext|>
I said a joke / under the stars / No laughter
<|endoftext|>
Lay the pencil / away – no more / thoughts, no lead
<|endoftext|>
How many cigarettes are you  / Smoking / To numb the buzzing behind / Your eyes?
<|endoftext|>
no words sitting alone night in my hut eyes closed hands open / wisps of an unknown face
<|endoftext|>
Don’t sleep with a poet. She will write pages of odes about your mouth on her thighs And how your lips trail like a comet down her calves.
<|endoftext|>
Cool sunny autumn day, / I’ll mow the lawn / one last time
<|endoftext|>
You (never) hurt me too. / (I don't know why) / I'm doing this. / (I'm sorry.)
<|endoftext|>
Kiss me like a / brash illicit paramour / no, we can't, we / hurried glances, stolen time / feels so right it / secretly in corridors / we'll get caught for
<|endoftext|>
I remember one quiet afternoon she fished out my cock / bent over played with it in her mouth for at least an hour
<|endoftext|>
we're lost born in delusions deeper than any mind / if you could escape awakening you'd ripen like a pear all by itself
<|endoftext|>
this person near death returns your cloak to you / slash it in half and it's still yours
<|endoftext|>
I am lying in a pool of your slowly coagulating blood / cracks and snaps of malice kick up small puffs of dust around me / I hear nothing but the steady rhythm of my machine gun / "die motherfucker, die" / Its been 3 hours since you died
<|endoftext|>
Yank through a knot with all the  / subtlety of a boxer, because that's  / what I was trained to do. Fight the  / world, beat it back from the doorstep  / never give them the upperhand  / and don't let them see you  / cry.
<|endoftext|>
not two not one either / and the unpainted breeze in the ink painting feels cool
<|endoftext|>
Quietly pouring coffee / in the afternoon, / How pleasant!
<|endoftext|>
You were down on one knee / I asked for a kiss / "Me first!" you exclaimed / And so began our bliss / I looked at our future / Sparkly and new
<|endoftext|>
you looked at me and asked if / i wanted to end / it / and i said no
<|endoftext|>
Now I'm reaching out for answers  / From a boy inside a box / Who couldn't reach the record  / And could only see the stop.
<|endoftext|>
Is this depression? / Is this ever going to get better? / As if people care.
<|endoftext|>
The barking dog / Kill him / With a bicycle wheel
<|endoftext|>
Who wrote anger in your eyes / and signed it / "I love you."
<|endoftext|>
The train speeding / thru emptiness / I was a trainman
<|endoftext|>
dry, skeleton stalks in gooseflesh Autumn fields  / ribcage falling as he exhales, as his heart pumps blood into breath into life
<|endoftext|>
we live in a cage of light an incredible cage / animals animals without end
<|endoftext|>
Christ on the Cross crying / his mother missed / Her October porridge
<|endoftext|>
He turns to page 683
<|endoftext|>
The gently moving / leaves / Of the August afternoon
<|endoftext|>
chrysanthemums hammered out of raw iron / that cloud gone now just like my father
<|endoftext|>
The days go / They cant stay / I don’t realize
<|endoftext|>
Blueberry dubbery / the chipmunk’s / In the grass
<|endoftext|>
Then we wave. / Then we act like we don't see each other, and enjoy our meal with / New friends. / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
I woke from a dream of death to day's amazing / death grass death rice death chairs death death asleep or awake
<|endoftext|>
Oh how you've snared me with your vines I cannot flee thee / Let me go, I ask; Oh darling wont you free me?
<|endoftext|>
Elephants munching / on grass loving / Head side by side
<|endoftext|>
Everything was silent / Delights and ends / Everything violent / You left a note / Right by the bed
<|endoftext|>
Neath a velvet black sea  / And deep in a silence unbroken by all  / We watched as the stars were beginning to fall.
<|endoftext|>
Dusk now – / what’s left of / An ancient pier
<|endoftext|>
And last I have the biggest part saved for the thought of you  / You may be gone but I recall the life we have been through / You were my wife, my love & life the day that we first met  / I can't recall the world and more, but you I can’t forget.
<|endoftext|>
self other right wrong wasting your life arguing / you're happy really you are happy
<|endoftext|>
Walking on the water wasn’t / Built in a day
<|endoftext|>
Just say the grace of your face / caused my heart pace / to elate at an alarming rate / and inspired a lust / only you can satiate / It must be fate.
<|endoftext|>
Little pieces of ice / in the moonlight / Snow, thousands of em
<|endoftext|>
We write in abstracts and hypotheticals  / guessing about a place we avoid.
<|endoftext|>
i kissed her / after sharing a / fifth of tequila / she told me she was damaged / and i should walk away
<|endoftext|>
In the late afternoon / peaks, I see / The hope
<|endoftext|>
Front hooves spread, / the mule scratches his / Neck along a log
<|endoftext|>
Hair suspended by gravity Its cessation a tragedy One scratch creates the whole I cannot grasp the brevity
<|endoftext|>
Sun on the rocks / a fighting snag / Holds on
<|endoftext|>
I think of your death I think of our touching / my head quiet in your lap
<|endoftext|>
I'd ask him to bring back Michael Jackson because the world needs something to smile at / I'd ask him to make sure Beyoncé never dies because we need someone to look up to and apparently, its not you / If I had God's phone number
<|endoftext|>
all the old masters want is money and fame / strike like a feather but when
<|endoftext|>
"How many hail Mary's until you make Pokémon real" or / "How's the signal up there in heaven? Because I don't think you've been getting my messages"
<|endoftext|>
Full moon / Pine tree / Old house
<|endoftext|>
We could have been happy / You and I / In another world, perhaps.
<|endoftext|>
Kicked the couch / Last night / She’s right / She's still here
<|endoftext|>
and then there was erica and charlize  / and and  / and that creepy mustache man  / twice my age  / and also those two guys  / at the same time.
<|endoftext|>
Spring evening / the two / Eighteen year old sisters
<|endoftext|>
Fuck you!
<|endoftext|>
one long pure beautiful road of pain / and the beauty of death and no pain
<|endoftext|>
Waiting for the leaves / to fall; / There goes one!
<|endoftext|>
The strumming of the trees / reminded me / Of immortal afternoon
<|endoftext|>
I've kept everything / just the way you like it.
<|endoftext|>
I like to save a little space for all my favourite songs  / like “In the Mood,” and “Cross Road Blues,” or “Where my heart belongs.” / I also like to save some room for Riddles to recite  / that way I can solve them quick so others think I’m bright.
<|endoftext|>
to excel there’s a need to expel  / excruciatingly, slowly, out of me, he arcs  / never knew whales were made of a million sparks…
<|endoftext|>
it's a hungry morning when I don't see her / more and more I love her and drink wine more
<|endoftext|>
The gypsy man plays on warm summer days / And on nights neath a lonesome bright star. / He plucks a soft tune as he howls at the moon / With the song of his Spanish Guitar.
<|endoftext|>
Is it possible I am depressed  / or am I just overthinking things?
<|endoftext|>
you were the sea / and i was underneath you
<|endoftext|>
Her good intentions also turned my love into a liar. / She told me that she left me not because she lost desire  / But because she wanted me to have some freedom and be happy. / I believed her, really just because I wanted to so badly. / I was happy at this point, although my freedom was subdued… / We said goodnight, and that was that. Forward a day or two
<|endoftext|>
oh yes things exist like the echo when you yell at the foot of a / huge mountain
<|endoftext|>
Cold crisp October morning / the cats fighting / In the weeds
<|endoftext|>
life's like climbing knife-tree hills with swords sticking up / day and night something stabs you
<|endoftext|>
The vigorous bell-ringing priest / the catch in the harbor
<|endoftext|>
This July evening, / A large frog / On my doorsill
<|endoftext|>
Early morning gentle rain, / two big bumblebees / Humming at their work
<|endoftext|>
The dark clouds rage  / The sea wind wails  / No dawn breaks  / I am at sea.
<|endoftext|>
What is Buddhism? / A crazy little / Bird blub
<|endoftext|>
He stood falling, flailing, endlessly / He'd always been alone / He knew what he had said was false / His heart had turned to stone.
<|endoftext|>
She sat next to him  / They shot the breeze  / I'm sure they grinned.
<|endoftext|>
when i was done talking  / and crying  / We sat in  / perfect / silence.
<|endoftext|>
the mind is exactly this tree that grass / without thought or feeling both disappear
<|endoftext|>
If I had God's phone number / I'd ask him "where are you?" / Because things aren't too good down here and I think we may need some divine intervention
<|endoftext|>
a smarter brain; one that is not broken like the old one / and i would keep riding my bike / tilting my head up at the sky every so often to scream joyously / because things were okay / and things were going to be okay / and i was going to be okay
<|endoftext|>
Ancient ancient world / tight skirts / By the new car
<|endoftext|>
"Shit can't you see." / "Just zombies bro, everywhere I go." / He laughs again.
<|endoftext|>
Brokenback goodshit / Heap bigshot / among the Birchtrees.
<|endoftext|>
Cradled and warm, / the upper snow, / The trackless
<|endoftext|>
Dawn – crows cawing, / ducks quack quacking, / Kitchen windows lighting
<|endoftext|>
brush ink plunge forward blind man who knows each step in the dark / the bristles dry dip again brush blind until you’re gone
<|endoftext|>
“I fucked him twice since I left you.” / you were inside of me when you said that. / so what? I don’t care. / “the second time I told him I never wanted to speak to him again.” / I cared even less.
<|endoftext|>
i wanted to put you in my pocket / and pretend you were a coin / i would roll you around / among the lint and spent
<|endoftext|>
Spring night – the sound / of the cat / Chewing fish heads
<|endoftext|>
Prayerbeads / on the Holy Book / My knees are cold
<|endoftext|>
rippling at its very ridges  / an inky night ocean / specked with drops of starlight / like static snowfall… / there are times / late at night
<|endoftext|>
frozen clock ticking vast vacuums  / of savory saturated seconds  / of crossed legs and eyes the color of undug gold; / soft brown irises blinking etched eternities
<|endoftext|>
The cow, taking a big / dreamy crap, turning / To look at me
<|endoftext|>
I drew them back into the sky / as stars for all the world to see. / She did not wake  / but only shifted her head / to fit more comfortably / inside the pocket
<|endoftext|>
Something was lost to us though – the tangible.
<|endoftext|>
The shame / of having to explain to my parents that every girl / I ever loved has turned out to be an addict
<|endoftext|>
If you invite a poet into your bed, She’ll carve stars into your palms So that every caress of yours Paints constellations across her skin. Complex enough to make an astronomer leap across her body
<|endoftext|>
I found my love in raven's wings  / in orange embers, in secret things  / in air's caress and quiet earth - / the catalysts of my rebirth.
<|endoftext|>
rice boils in my broken-footed iron pot / it’s everything but you can’t taste it
<|endoftext|>
Her happy carefree spirit was like / The sun lighting a room
<|endoftext|>
My happy family of hardship in an instant slashed  / To a melancholy fellow thinking only of his past. / “’Tis better to have loved and lost;” I beg to disagree  / For what I lost I’d not yet got when fate took it from me.
<|endoftext|>
At least, I think he does; / maybe I just want him to.
<|endoftext|>
Change Su Chi’s art / studio, a silent / Shade in the window
<|endoftext|>
The hermit’s broom, / the fire, the kettle / August night
<|endoftext|>
wife daughters friends this is for you satori / is mistake after mistake
<|endoftext|>
Gossiping takes practice when / time is never of the essence. / God has not aged well and / is in danger of becoming  / a neo-spiritualist. He wears / glasses like Buddy Holly and / practices yoga. Stay  / flexible. Stay relevant.
<|endoftext|>
all poems just lead you on / but not the delicious pussy of the young girls I go down on
<|endoftext|>
OO a continent / in a birdbath / April full moon
<|endoftext|>
here I am simply trying to get into your head / you think you were born you die what a pity
<|endoftext|>
I wish you’d up and leave me / I wish you’d up and leave / I wish you / I wish things / Were better for us
<|endoftext|>
and evergreen flashes filled with / sparks of the light you can catch when it's / filtered through leaves.
<|endoftext|>
I hope you think sometimes / Of what is missing.
<|endoftext|>
I've carried on and now your gone / I waited patient for the dawn
<|endoftext|>
I think our minds, like many things, are limited in space  / our thoughts and things we like to know all need their proper place. / Although our minds are vastly wide, they really aren’t that deep / so we must choose from what must go and what we want to keep.
<|endoftext|>
I went in the woods / to meditate / It was too cold
<|endoftext|>
Winter – that / sparrow’s nest / Still empty
<|endoftext|>
Let tears dampen cheeks today  / Let whimpers pierce the night. / Let despair have its way, for once  / to soften terror's bite.
<|endoftext|>
I'm alive! right? don't we say that? / we don't see the bones we walk on
<|endoftext|>
River wonderland – / The emptiness / Of the golden eternity
<|endoftext|>
Drunk as a hoot owl / writing letters / By thunderstorm
<|endoftext|>
There is no deep / turning-about / In the Void
<|endoftext|>
Little frogs screaming / in the ditch / At nightfall
<|endoftext|>
My knees quivered / The air was thin / I wanted to jump / Then I saw your grin / You climbed the ladder
<|endoftext|>
Gary Snyder / is a haiku / far away
<|endoftext|>
ten years of whorehouse joy I'm alone now in the mountains / the pines are like a jail the wind scratches my skin
<|endoftext|>
they screw inside the temple call in students for “mysterious satori” / only I teach like the seasons
<|endoftext|>
Mist boiling from the / ridge the mountains / Are clean
<|endoftext|>
we spend our saturdays watching cartoons  / or rather, the cartoonish way everything seems to move  / flashes and glitches like bad programming.
<|endoftext|>
Words are drugs- a filthy vice. Your / livelihood pays dealer's price. In- / hale the smoke of burning page. A / high produced by mindless rage.
<|endoftext|>
"guys"  / breasts  / breasts  / breasts  / is that all you have going for you  / hey  / remember that time you wanted to fuck  / and i was the one who got fucked
<|endoftext|>
Ive never contemplated beauty until i met you.  / Things were either beautiful or they weren't.  / Beauty was categorical; it was subjective. / The beauty of a rose and that of a child’s laughter were two very different draughts that drew from the same wellspring…
<|endoftext|>
Frozen / in the birdbath, / A leaf
<|endoftext|>
Cold gray tufts / of winter grass / Under the stars
<|endoftext|>
you looked at me and asked if / it was the right thing to do / to end / it / and i said yes
<|endoftext|>
Am I a flower / bee, that you / Stare at me?
<|endoftext|>
The jazz trombone, / The moving curtain, / Spring rain
<|endoftext|>
oh green green willow wonderfully red flower / but I know the colors are not there
<|endoftext|>
I say things like "Good Morning," I smile. I leave a tip. / She says things like "the usual?" and "Have a nice day!".
<|endoftext|>
Mild spring night / a teenage girl said / "Good evening" in the dark
<|endoftext|>
The bottoms of my shoes / are clean / From walking in the rain
<|endoftext|>
Someday I'll tell you a funny story / About how getting lost with you one afternoon made me feel like I was exactly where I needed to be / That when you held me and eased my childish fears after a long night of drinking, it felt like love / And when I woke to find you asleep a full 12 inches away, I wished it was a different kind of love
<|endoftext|>
nobody understands my no Zen Zen / not even that crow's shattering bleak scream got it
<|endoftext|>
A quiet moment / low lamp, low logs / Just cooking the stew
<|endoftext|>
I'd love to give you something / but what would help?
<|endoftext|>
Kiss me like a stranger / hesitant and questioning / is this okay / shock of hair between your eyes / can I – may I / feathering like fumbled rain / should I stop or
<|endoftext|>
May grass / Nothing much / To do
<|endoftext|>
The trees, already / bent in the windless / Oklahoma plain
<|endoftext|>
Racing westward through / the clouds in the howling / wind, the moon
<|endoftext|>
And thinks of me
<|endoftext|>
shut the circuit off / rearranged the wires / i wanted to / start over
<|endoftext|>
Dusk the bird / on the fence / A contemporary of mine
<|endoftext|>
a broken sleeper, never to wake up / I didn't like you / but we were brothers forged in the crucible / our eagle globe and anchor made us family
<|endoftext|>
All I ever wanted was candles on a birthday cake.
<|endoftext|>
Looking up to see / the airplane / I only saw the TV aerial
<|endoftext|>
have you ever seen him naked?  / this boy without clothes or a wall about him  / trembling not from lack of warmth, nor out of shame  / baring his being: his solitary belly button, the yawning thing between his legs
<|endoftext|>
know nothing I know nothing nobody does can you face me / and know nothing know
<|endoftext|>
hear the cruel no-answer until blood drips down / beat your head against the wall of it
<|endoftext|>
one day a crab decided to enroll in a liberal arts college and the crab became a hipster crab and all his crab friends left him because they said he read too much and quoted passages from tao lin constantly

And the pieces he’s lost / What his choices have cost / Have torn his conscious to shreds
<|endoftext|>
The sunset is caramel dripping down the buildings / And I am willing to bet / That the grass smells nothing like your fingers catching on my cheek when you pinned me down / On the mossy clover hill behind the church last summer.
<|endoftext|>
the wise know nothing at all / well maybe one song
<|endoftext|>
I'd ask him if diseases and natural disasters were really necessary / I'd ask him where in this "master plan" he managed to fit racism and hatred / I'd remind him of the massacres in his name / I'd remind him of the Crusades, people set aflame because their faith was different
<|endoftext|>
Abbid abbayd ingrat / Lighthouse / On the Azores
<|endoftext|>
Do you know why my name is Jack? / Why? / That’s why.
<|endoftext|>
no money in a dream plums simple and close / five thousand coins in a row in a dream of power
<|endoftext|>
Beautiful young girls running / up the library steps / With shorts on
<|endoftext|>
Whatever it is, I quit / now I'll let my / breath out –
<|endoftext|>
sick of it whatever it's called sick of the names / I dedicate every pore to what's here
<|endoftext|>
The sight of you left me gasping for air / The way you smile, the way you glare / Back when I didn’t know what you had in store / To hurt me more / Hurt me more
<|endoftext|>
keep writing those deep questions sleep on / when you wake even you'll be gone
<|endoftext|>
The poet will drag haikus out of your eyes How they are green like patches of overwatered grass And tell stories of centuries come to pass. 17 syllables on how you are so young and yet seem ancient like the great kings of old.
<|endoftext|>
I found my love in war's deep scars  / in circuit boards, in prison bars  / in sleeping dust and rising smoke - / my soul answered when my love spoke.
<|endoftext|>
At a Coney Island / hamburger / In Vancouver Washington
<|endoftext|>
the way she is now: / three months since I last touched land  / held rain, but she changed / from grainy black-and-white polaroids / to sharp neon edges
<|endoftext|>
raining or not / walk lifting your heavy wet sleeves
<|endoftext|>
Pink petals on / gnarly Japanese twigs / In rain
<|endoftext|>
i remember when i fucked / for the first time  / i was 18 and stick-thin and awkward  / and i didn’t know his name
<|endoftext|>
i'll live dangerously  / buy a train ticket to anywhere / and not tell anyone where i'm going / and i'll wind up in a place where the pines grow free and strong
<|endoftext|>
I dared not move, I kept quite still / And so it was with no small thrill  / She neared to me, arm’s length or less / And did not run from my caress  / Yet she still trembled at my touch; / So met the fox and I.
<|endoftext|>
They say things like "Good Morning," they smile. They leave a tip. / She says things like "the usual?" and "Have a nice day!".
<|endoftext|>
the edges of the sword are life and death / no one knows which is which
<|endoftext|>
Swinging on delicate hinges / the Autumn Leaf / Almost off the stem
<|endoftext|>
a flower held up twirled between human fingers / a smile barely visible
<|endoftext|>
Not waiting to take breath  / Nor ink to dry  / Never posing the question / “why?”
<|endoftext|>
the car is not stopping / my eyes are closed / i am thinking hard / the giant hamster wheels in my brain are spinning really fast / in my head i am eighteen years old
<|endoftext|>
do you remember when / we decided to end / the / damn / thing
<|endoftext|>
Full moon of October / The tiny mew / of the Kitty
<|endoftext|>
hundreds of peaks but only one lone bell out of nowhere / maple groves tipped by stars fixed above the inlet
<|endoftext|>
Morning sarcastically caresses  / each pit, bump and scar on my left  / cheek. I find I have started to like  / the right half of my face more  / partially veiled in brief 7 o'clock  / shadows.
<|endoftext|>
Under that neon lamplight, mothers bring their children to the flies, like a baptism for the dead; / The children shove their faces into the gas station windows, or else watch the backs of their fathers / Who look onto their land, its illimitable suffering, and roll it up into suicide cigars.
<|endoftext|>
Our kids are graduating. / We see each other at the ceremony. / We wave. / The kids ask us who we are. / Nobody. / They run to their / New friends. / Passing time.
<|endoftext|>
O Sebastian, where art thou? / Pa, watch over us! / Saints, thank you!
<|endoftext|>
Just wanna get this out. / I lost my keys. / I'm confused. / I'm so confused.
<|endoftext|>
The maze is full of  / Circles and dead ends.  / Two may enter a pair  / But part as just friends.
<|endoftext|>
It seemed content to simply be  / And, found that I could not / Return it free and skyward bound. / So, stuffed it in my pock't.
<|endoftext|>
Phantom Rose / Lust / Is a Leopard
<|endoftext|>
she took hundreds of photos on disposable / cameras which she flung in drawers / to be forgotten  / small moments of past lust and / ordinary pleasures / neglected for the present.
<|endoftext|>
Parcel out, bubbled & shrink wrapped  / morsels of my Westside flank  / catapult the bloody mess / over the hovering stratosphere / of Cape Canaveral’s base
<|endoftext|>
You only love me in the dark.  / I only miss you in the light.  / as morning's first kiss peeks your rosy cheek  / your feelings fade away  / and my longing begins to grow.
<|endoftext|>
I lost my co-ordinates years ago.
<|endoftext|>
but too often it reads like / you took a piss on my porch and sighed. / if the petals you dribble over my bed / are rotted through, plucked from a bouquet / you threw out two months ago
<|endoftext|>
Bluejay drinking at my / saucer of milk, / Throwing his head back
<|endoftext|>
Autumn nite / the boys / playing haiku.
<|endoftext|>
A big fat flake / of snow / Falling all alone
<|endoftext|>
The barn, swimming / in a sea / Of windblown leaves
<|endoftext|>
The forecast said clear skies  / But there's 100% chance of rain / north of my heart, tonight.
<|endoftext|>
I cannot help but have it myself / you see  / I know that smile / And throughout the days
<|endoftext|>
The smoke of old / naval battles / Is gone
<|endoftext|>
By the echoes of her high-heeled retreat / And practice. / Great like the end of the wife’s / Goddamn nagging
<|endoftext|>
and She said  / maybe we ummm shouldn’t  / see  / each  / other  / any / more
<|endoftext|>
and he still has some months to go? / i like crabs / crabs are nice
<|endoftext|>
I have to admit my passion never leaves / fire is the master young grasses appear each spring
<|endoftext|>
You used to climb trees / and whisper your secrets into their rough skin. / now, you say  / you have little time / for that kind of thing.
<|endoftext|>
It’s as if the sun and the horizon met and set in your eyes.  / If your feet ever touched the floor, i find the sky would grow unbearably jealous of the earth
<|endoftext|>
A yellow witch chewing / a cigarette, / Those Autumn leaves
<|endoftext|>
A stump with sawdust / a place / To meditate
<|endoftext|>
Rat Pack rhymes / And Blues that still had soul. / Great like sacrosanct springing suburbs / With two-car garages / And no bursting bubbles
<|endoftext|>
Too hot to write / haiku – crickets / and mosquitoes
<|endoftext|>
What the fuck is wrong with you?
<|endoftext|>
I yelled at my mum today. / I'm really sorry / I'm fine mom.
<|endoftext|>
do you feel like the whole world is turning against you / underneath the stars as you throw back another shot / laughter all around but only silence ringing through your ears / Chocolate and whiskey lingering on my tongue / from the night I tried to drink away my demons
<|endoftext|>
The morning began with coffee and toast / And browsing the web for news / The world was a veritable hotbed it seemed / Of geopolitical feud
<|endoftext|>
I don’t feel like I deserve them / And when they discard me / I’m less bitter and more grateful / Grateful that I was allowed to know them
<|endoftext|>
eat the wind eat the water nobody can say how / I know a man who stood twenty years on Gojo bridge
<|endoftext|>
Free as a pine / goofing / For the wind
<|endoftext|>
Brighter than the night, / my barn roof / Of snow
<|endoftext|>
I sit by the window behind a notebook and thick frames. Another notebook with thick frames sits at the counter, more thick frames with laptops sit at tables.
<|endoftext|>
They shake their glossed bald heads at the local UPS  / scoff when I suggest overnight express. / Not even the reliable men & women of FedEx / can aid my victory for intergalactic acclaim.
<|endoftext|>
raindrops falling on some windowpane somewhere while you drink hot coffee and contemplate your life
<|endoftext|>
horseshit  / but when I told Her I loved her  / She just said  / that’s so very nice to  / hear
<|endoftext|>
Forms. / Urine samples. / Blood tests. / Questionnaires. / Diagnoses. / Discharge.
<|endoftext|>
Most of her is asleep by now  
<|endoftext|>
So I bite my tongue / And grate my teeth / Because I know underneath / the cleverly constructed guise / lies a beast / And within me  / the power to arrive at a future much better  / and in you  / terrible; down to the letter.
<|endoftext|>
I dun – I dunno either baby...
<|endoftext|>
There’s a whale  / dwelling in the wishing well of my stomach  / like the universe, a widening plummet
<|endoftext|>
talk about family laws ideals my silence drives me mad / without passion and ignorance none of it works
<|endoftext|>
and mattresses  / matching yellow / ottomans and cell service  / too. But life's alright / despite the fits -- / I just don't wanna die / like Sylvia did.
<|endoftext|>
My hands on my lap / June night, / Full moon
<|endoftext|>
Spring is coming / Yep, all that equipment / for sighs
<|endoftext|>
as infinite as we’d think it to be  / and that our lives or this world  / for that matter, aren’t nearly as infinite / as we’d think them to be
<|endoftext|>
Night – six petals / have fallen from / Bodhidharma’s bouquet
<|endoftext|>
Good news and bad news. / I almost reached the point of no return.
<|endoftext|>
Two cars passing / on the freeway / Husband and wife
<|endoftext|>
Having talent is a skill. As / is rendering talent obsolete when / someone has to be. Goddamnit. / He’s gone and done it. He’s / broken those legs that made / strong men cry.
<|endoftext|>
Vixens, pixies, sirens, gypsies / They fill a void in me every time / And every time I fill them / With my “love” and bullshit
<|endoftext|>
I called – Dipankara / instructed me / By saying nothing
<|endoftext|>
She loves Lysander / not Demetrius / Who? Hermia
<|endoftext|>
born born everything is always born / thinking about it try not to
<|endoftext|>
pimples and a birthmark cast like a strange parasite  / a scar and battlefields of stretch marks on his bum  / which even then, is lovely in its own way
<|endoftext|>
don’t expect kisses in return. / because roses? they reek. / and this is a fucking cliché.
<|endoftext|>
Spring night / a leaf falling / From my chimney
<|endoftext|>
pine needles inches deep hug the ground / no one lives here
<|endoftext|>
Friends turn away their faces / Family show pity in their smiles / I crawl forever forward / So many empty miles
<|endoftext|>
“Don’t be like me,” / I said. / “Don’t dread the days you can’t even see. / Don’t die while you can still breathe.”
<|endoftext|>
The leaves, fighting / the empty sky / No clouds helping
<|endoftext|>
Hurrying things along, / Autumn rain / On my awning
<|endoftext|>
A car is coming but / the cat knows / It's not a snake
<|endoftext|>
Night rain – neighbors / Arguing loud voices / In next house
<|endoftext|>
flowers are silent silence is silent the mind / is a silent flower the silent flower of the world opens
<|endoftext|>
Perfect moonlit night / marred / By family squabbles
<|endoftext|>
Creating by memory Every stroke symmetry The product of her conscience All sensory
<|endoftext|>
All you write about are faces / without souls. What about my soul? / Are you going to / fucking write about my soul?
<|endoftext|>
Lilacs at dusk / one petal / fell
<|endoftext|>
I found my sparrow Sonrin dead one morning / and buried him just as gently as I would my own daughter
<|endoftext|>
The national scene / late afternoon sun / In those trees
<|endoftext|>
and -in it’s unfathomable sadness- its tears would drench the land; its wails exclaiming themselves through booming thunder. / And every day… Every moment that came before you ceases to be. As if your presence rewrote my entire existence.
<|endoftext|>
Losing huge chunks of time. / I don't know what to do anymore. / I don't know what to say. / I don't know what this is anymore.
<|endoftext|>
of my celestial shoulder  / stirring off further / down the rabbit hole / of another dream. / Now wherever I'm without her  / whenever I look up into the night  / I see her beautiful face / strewn across a bottomless canvas  / and I pray beyond a reasonable faith / she will one day deliver upon me / this same courtesy-
<|endoftext|>
Replaced by memories fond of / You and I / And what we had together.
<|endoftext|>
but no one spooned like  / rob  / and no one blew like  / fahad  / and the pill blake gave me put me right in the  / mood
<|endoftext|>
The clouds assume / as I assume, / Faces of hermits
<|endoftext|>
this is the first poem  / i hope you do not have high expectations for it  / it is just like all the other poems  / lowercase and sad  / i am lowercase and sad  / i should move to an island somewhere  / where happiness is outlawed  / and if you display external happiness you are shot in the town square  / and people watch and point and laugh  / but mirthlessly, because they do not want to be shot  / 
<|endoftext|>
do you remember the time / you gave yourself to me / and i took you for granted
<|endoftext|>
Love is a subtle thing. / The sound of your barefoot feet  / the quick glance and little smile. / The way you say my name  / Your way.
<|endoftext|>
Nored the Atlantican Astrologer / weeps because the King / Laid his Autumn girl!
<|endoftext|>
when I was forty-seven everybody came to see me / so I walked out forever
<|endoftext|>
Spring evening / hobo with hard on / Like bamboo
<|endoftext|>
only one koan matters / you
<|endoftext|>
Misurgirafical & plomlied / ding dang / The Buddha’s gang
<|endoftext|>
all the bad things I do will go up in smoke / and so will I
<|endoftext|>
I spot an exit on the deck  / I wrap it tightly 'round my neck
<|endoftext|>
Grain Elevators on / Saturday waiting for / The farmers to come home
<|endoftext|>
I went half crazy studying sitting for days now the one thing / is fishermen's songs sunset rain clouds the river night after night
<|endoftext|>
The postman is late / The toilet window / Is shining
<|endoftext|>
Grasp a hunk of mouse-brown hair  / in my fist and drag the brush through  / the ends. I have no idea if this is  / how you do it; mom never taught me  / never braided me in pigtails  / or pulled it back in a pony. Never  / bothered.
<|endoftext|>
She said, "I think today  / will be the last day I live." / And I asked her for one more.
<|endoftext|>
Propped up on my shoe / the Diamond Sutra / Propped up on a pine root
<|endoftext|>
Oh I could drink up / The whole Yellow River / In my love for Li Po!
<|endoftext|>
After a year and a half / finally saw the rat / Big and fat
<|endoftext|>
When the moon sinks / down to the power line, / I'll go in
<|endoftext|>
you won't even be here to read them / what stupidity to put these words into your mouth
<|endoftext|>
your smug face smugly smugging at me smuggingly  / chin so sharp you have to watch out when you look down  / so you don't stab yourself in the neck and bleed to death  / you’re like  / "guys look at my breasts"
<|endoftext|>
The microscopic red bugs / in the sea-side sand / Do they meet and greet?
<|endoftext|>
Unending linchpin Practiced repetition Interrupting the process Is not my intention
<|endoftext|>
I'd give anything: / My bicycle / Ten years / A rib
<|endoftext|>
That is not beautiful / It is not beautiful to hate yourself / Or to wish you didn’t exist / It is painful and broken and fucking wrong / not romantic / It is tragic / Not tragically beautiful
<|endoftext|>
who teaches truth? good/ bad the wrong way / Crazy Cloud knows the taste of his own shit / long love letters brief passionate poems
<|endoftext|>
"only an idiot holds himself back / for someone who doesn't mind / being unknowable"
<|endoftext|>
Snow melting, / streams rushing / Lookout leave the valley
<|endoftext|>
In the morning frost / the cats / Stepped slowly
<|endoftext|>
Nights  / have lost their glow.
<|endoftext|>
A spring mosquito / dont even know / How to bite!
<|endoftext|>
and then i got grindr  / he asked  / do you do this often?  / as i followed him to the toilet  / in the bus station.  / i said no, i promise
<|endoftext|>
Great like a home-cooked meal at six / Respect for your elders / And actual conversation. / Great like homecoming dances / And the national anthem;
<|endoftext|>
And the quiet cat / sitting by the post / Perceives the moon
<|endoftext|>
What passes through / is amusing / Himself being dew
<|endoftext|>
Gray spring rain / I never clipped / My hedges 
<|endoftext|>
Two line love poem: / Not even the moon / has such a soft glaze.
<|endoftext|>
wow / things got pretty dark there / so i want to lighten the mood / just for a little while / darks and lights, you know / that’s what bob ross said
<|endoftext|>
The whiteness of the houses / in the moon / Snow everywhere
<|endoftext|>
don't hesitate get laid that's wisdom / sitting around chanting what crap
<|endoftext|>
A bottle of wine, / a bishop / Everything is God
<|endoftext|>
"Woo!" – bird of perfect / balance on the fir / Just moved his tail
<|endoftext|>
Water in a hole / behold / The soddden skies
<|endoftext|>
and then Bridget and I  / made the sweetest love  / even though  / she was drunk  / and even though  / she has a rape  / fantasy  / and her finger slid  / into my  / butt  / and the next morning
<|endoftext|>
Moon behind / Black clouds / Silver seas
<|endoftext|>
High in the Sky / the Fathers Send Messages / From on High
<|endoftext|>
And so I told him  / “When the monsters vacate the space beneath your bed  / And take up homes in our hearts and heroes. / That’s how you’ll know.
<|endoftext|>
You’re different when you drink
<|endoftext|>
Jack reads his book / aloud at nite / the stars come out.
<|endoftext|>
clouds very high look / not one word helped them get up there
<|endoftext|>
in the freezing hall one night in a flimsy robe I hallucinated gold-threaded cloth / it hung in the air uselessly
<|endoftext|>
we're lost where the mind can't find us / utterly lost
<|endoftext|>
and sometimes there is chaos, within our ranks / we hash things out with facebook and fists / and soldiers have fallen, but we will not forget / bong rips for frankie, give 'em hell kid.
<|endoftext|>
Love for Flag, God and Country  / To thee, I pledge. / Great like soda fountains  / And Drive-Thru movies
<|endoftext|>
This is a far cry from wine in the north of Italy  / Petty mud-water that stares with its greasy eyes  / A little flatfish waiting to seize its prey. / My head nods on the counter
<|endoftext|>
and you were too busy being someone else's  / because i do  / you've changed so much  / you are upstater than me  / you are a party girl  / you are having fun without me
<|endoftext|>
nature's a killer I won't sing to it / I hold my breath and listen to the dead singing under the grass
<|endoftext|>
Late into the night / When moonlight filters through my curtains / and my eyes are at half-mast / and my body is limp with approaching sleep / I still feel her hand caressing my hair
<|endoftext|>
white-haired priest in his eighties / this person still sings aloud each night to himself to the sky to the clouds / because she gave herself freely / her hands her mouth her breasts her long moist thighs
