Had the worst dream today.
I almost didn't get out of bed. 

Why the hell is it getting worse? 

Is it possible I am depressed, 
or am I just overthinking things? 

I don't know if I'm depressed or not.
What's an official diagnosis? 

Am I actually depressed?
I was never depressed until now. 

Do I have an intellectual disability?
I have no idea what to do.
I think I'm dumb.
I don't know how to deal with this. 

I don't really know anything anymore. I'm lost.
I have no idea what I'm doing with my life.
I feel like it's too late for my life to go anywhere.
I feel like I've bled out all of my potential. 

Everything is gray.
I don't know what this feeling is, I was hoping someone could help me. 

Help? 

Anyone else here feel like loneliness is the biggest reason for their depression?
Talking to other people isn't pleasurable. I think I'm fucking crazy.
Lonely and wishing I was dead. 

Just want to talk to someone.
Should I tell my best friend that I am having suicidal thoughts? 
Friends don't exist. 

My mother has cancer, I just lost my best friend, my grades are slipping and I still haven't felt a single thing. 

That's it. I give up.

Why should I even try?
Everything's going to shit.
Why bother? 

Finally got round to getting some psychiatric support. Hope it helps.
I'm slipping back again and there is nothing
I can do about it. 

How will I know if Wellbutrin is working?
I stopped feeling bad.
Life is just whatever.
Without my negativity
I feel like I don't have any drive. 

Just wanna get this out.
I lost my keys.
I'm confused.
I'm so confused.
My health is deteriorating and there’s nothing the doctors can do.
Hello. 

I feel the depression coming back, I'm scared of losing my boyfriend. 

Does anyone else feel like their ex was holding everything together? 

First time alone in my new apartment and I can't stop crying. 

I can't take it anymore.
Sick of this crap. Nothing helps for long. Too old for this shit.
So angry all the time.
I’ve actually orgasmed
to the thought of shooting myself. 

Everything is worse at night.
I don't kill myself for the same reasons I want to. 

Good news and bad news.
I almost reached the point of no return. 

I don't know.
I feel like everyone hates me... and I'm just someone people "deal with".
Dependent. 

Self-reflections.
How could you could make your death look accidental? 

I guess I drank too much again.
Alone.
Need to get out.
I don't want to go.
The world always wants to remind me
I'm inferior. 
I want to leave it all behind. 

I wanna do something but I just don't feel like it.
I just want to be alone. I hate feeling lonely. 

Losing huge chunks of time.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what this is anymore.
When will this disease go away?
I'm sick of trying.
Every day is a struggle. 

I cannot hold it together anymore.
I've never felt this depressed ever.
The worst I've ever felt.
Perhaps it's time for something drastic. 

Back on XANAX and Lexapro.
Not making progress, running out of options.
I'm scared that I've hit a really low point in my life, with no way to climb back up. 

I am just so damn unhappy.
I've forgotten how to be happy. 

The truth about depression.
Bad decisions.
The small things.
Who am I?
The never-ending spiral that began somewhere in the past. 

It happened tonight.
After a long time, I find my reason to try.
Heart pounding? 

I think my girlfriend is getting sick of my shit. 

Why doesn't depression hurt anymore?
I may have forgotten what happiness is. 

It's that time of the year again.
Day one of not feeling like eating.

needy texts,

Sometimes I think

I’ll be buried as the Byzantines

My heart skips a beat

A young boy

Sits in a galactic carriage

He turns to page 683 

And thinks of me

<|endoftext|>

Most of her is asleep by now

<|endoftext|>

For brevity’s sake, I’m doing okay.
You may have noticed there, 
that pause that I placed,
so you might be aware
that I’m desperately struggling
to surface for air,
and failing in the worst kind of way.
But to avoid melodrama,
and an uncomfortable silence,
I’ll bite it back and say,
“I’m doing okay.” 
Yeah, 
I’m doing just fine.

<|endoftext|>

They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something.
If that is true then I am a master of sleeping alone.
Nights upon nights of twin mattresses,
I racked up hours,
Nine at a time,
To be the best at being alone.
I would fill the silence with a fan blowing sweet static into my ear until I slumbered.
It was perfect.
Then you ruined it,
That night I slept wrapped around you,
I didn't need blankets,
Your slow, regular breaths were warm enough,
And the mechanical whir of the fan 
was replaced by your
Palpable,
Heartbeat.
I thought I had mastered sleeping alone,
Then in that one night,
I just forgot how,
Next to you,
Near you.

I saved a message you left me on my answering machine.
It says:
"Hey, I was just thinking of you ... [long pause] ... anyway, call me back when you get the chance, bye."

Hearing your voice is the only way I can fall asleep now.

<|endoftext|>

What is stranger than a stranger?
A meeting 13 billion years in the making.
What countless causes conspired for this coincidence of conditions?

What have the fates brought to me today?
A herald, here to deliver me from the monotony of mundanity?
A lover, here to explore uncharted vistas of my soul?
A hitler, here to lead me to madness and to ruin?

Sitting so close that our heartbeats syncopate,
Yet between us a gulf too deep for words to fill,
Too wide to dare to bridge. 

<|endoftext|>

Sometimes she'd speak like a pirate
Just to get a laugh

If a giggle was worth a nickel
I couldn't finish the math

Her happy carefree spirit was like
The sun lighting a room

But then somehwere down the line
My mind ignored the clues

Her appearance became fewer
Like flowers approaching winter

I should've seen the signs
And tried to keep her nearer

I have not heard from her now
For years on end

And not a day goes by that I don't wish
She was still my friend.

<|endoftext|>

The girls that spiral into my life
Come with little invitation
More like, with no invitation
They find me, part the curtains and enter
Vixens, pixies, sirens, gypsies
They fill a void in me every time
And every time I fill them
With my “love” and bullshit
But since that’s all I am
I was never untrue
Lovely limbs and flushed cheeks
Quick wit, hopes and dreams
I don’t feel like I deserve them
And when they discard me
I’m less bitter and more grateful
Grateful that I was allowed to know them
Inside and out
And I’m hopeful
That they will make
A better mistake next time
That I can be
A better mistake
Next time

<|endoftext|>

i kissed her
after sharing a
fifth of tequila
she told me she was damaged
and i should walk away
i don't know if it was 
disbelief
apathy
or loneliness
but i didn't listen.

i drink whiskey now.

I think our minds, like many things, are limited in space,
our thoughts and things we like to know all need their proper place.
Although our minds are vastly wide, they really aren’t that deep
so we must choose from what must go and what we want to keep.

I like to save a little space for all my favourite songs,
like “In the Mood,” and “Cross Road Blues,” or “Where my heart belongs.”
I also like to save some room for Riddles to recite,
that way I can solve them quick so others think I’m bright.

I put aside a tiny space for how food made me feel,
the taste, the scent, the honesty of hearty home-cooked meals.
I can’t forget the way you used to dance around and bake,
And every year without a word, we’d have my favourite cake.

I may be old but I recall the plot of your first book,
Where Mary fell in love with Henry Gimble’s Pastry Cook 
I also have a corner kept for all the art you drew,
I always liked the one you did of Howard feeling blue.

And last I have the biggest part saved for the thought of you,
You may be gone but I recall the life we have been through
You were my wife, my love & life the day that we first met, 
I can't recall the world and more, but you I can’t forget.

<|endoftext|>

You used to climb trees
and whisper your secrets into their rough skin.
now, you say,
you have little time
for that kind of thing.

But I still remember you,
blood beading on your forearms from the time you climbed that tree
whose trunk was thick as the words which had caught in your throat
and you could barely manage to grip its sides.
You hugged that tree closer than any lover
a tangle of limbs and dripping sweat,
rough hands grasping at the hard knots and taut sinews
of twisting bodies.

Now you grasp at bodies behind closed doors and under sheets.
Your hands are soft, free of the callouses and wild passion of the climber.
You tell yourself that you’ve grown up.

You’ve forgotten how to make love under the open sky.

<|endoftext|>

We could have been happy
You and I
In another world, perhaps.

We wanted different things
You and I
But wanted so many things alike.

On different paths we were
You and I
Crossing for a time too short.

The bitterness and anger between
You and I
Are gone, like the ashes of the fire.

Replaced by memories fond of
You and I
And what we had together.

I hope you think sometimes
Of what is missing.

<|endoftext|>

We walked through the meadow, 
the moonlight and me,
When night held the earth
Neath a velvet black sea,
And deep in a silence unbroken by all,
We watched as the stars were beginning to fall.

The meadow grass waved
to the whim of the breeze;
Those shooting stars fell to the will of black seas.
But I and the moonlight, 
’Til nighttime had passed,
Just sat there alone in that sweet meadow grass. 

<|endoftext|>

They say time heals all wounds.
Now I don't know if that's true, but I will tell you a year doesn't cut it.
One day you will see that you weren't wrong.
But neither was I.
Things happen.
People change.
And I still love you despite it all. 

<|endoftext|>

That goddamned ear sticking out of her
God. Damned. Hair.
Timid
Gaudy
Supplicating
An elf surely 

The way she rolls her ankle
In her white high-top Converse

I suppose that after rapaciously consuming enough pornography, some folks start to look at the little things again.
She raises her hand
Clears her throat
Kisses a homely, sonorous alto
Into the air 

Caramel
Honey
Heroin 

I'd give anything:
My bicycle
Ten years
A rib

“I fucked him twice since I left you.”
you were inside of me when you said that.
so what? I don’t care.
“the second time I told him I never wanted to speak to him again.”
I cared even less.

my heart was swollen
and I was drunk
and didn’t cry
until you fell asleep.

<|endoftext|>

Is it the weather?
Is it the mood?
Am i lost in some deep brood?
I am at sea sir, at sea. 

No bay to make port,
No gull to find land,
No psiren calling towards a fitting end,
I am at sea sir, at sea.

The dark clouds rage,
The sea wind wails,
No dawn breaks,
I am at sea.

Sir i am at sea,
Flotsam upon this world,
Blessed by the bounty of waves,
yet directionless i do stay,
I am at sea sir.

Do you think her kisses taste like helium?
Do you get lifted off your toes when you see her, your heart ascending to meet hers in a solar cadenza?
When her hair moves and the light hits it a certain way, can you tell it’s woven with bits of wheat and prairie grass?
Are her fingers always this sticky with maple syrup, sugar leaking out of every pore, embalmed in vestal amber sap?

While my knuckles bled and my fingertips blistered, while I fell on my knees and trenched them to free the twisted cartilage inside, ripped pages out of books for attention, clanged pots and pans together and built bonfire skeletons from sonnets, wedging them under my bed instead, she waited

She’s here now, she’s arrived and she’s staying because she is molasses and i’m vinegar at best.

<|endoftext|>

Let tears dampen cheeks today,
Let whimpers pierce the night.
Let despair have its way, for once,
to soften terror's bite. 

Have your rest, make peace with death,
Then rise! Resolve anew.
Let anger ring with steadfast silence,
And actions with purpose true. 

Let them come again in force,
To see the fallen in our eyes.
Let them cower in retreat, knowing,
That a martyr never dies. 

<|endoftext|>

Two words repeating over and over
rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom
it’s my eighth shot of crown in half an hour,
tell me baby, do you feel dangerous, reckless,
do you feel like the whole world is turning against you
underneath the stars as you throw back another shot
laughter all around but only silence ringing through your ears
Chocolate and whiskey lingering on my tongue
from the night I tried to drink away my demons
the night I broke down and told you I loved you, the night you just said “I know”
all I could think was “I am in love with you,
you are going to break me and I am going to let you”
Baby, drunk tongues speak sober thoughts
It burned my mouth the first time you kissed me
fireball and rum and your lips against mine
it felt like heaven but hurt like hell
because I knew it was just alcohol and loneliness
but my god, I’ll never forget your hand on the back of my neck
and the love story your tongue told mine

<|endoftext|>

I am lying in a pool of your slowly coagulating blood
cracks and snaps of malice kick up small puffs of dust around me
I hear nothing but the steady rhythm of my machine gun
"die motherfucker, die"
Its been 3 hours since you died
and I have yet to come to terms with it
you are still at my side
arms splayed out at an awkward angle
head tilted unnaturally to the side
a broken sleeper, never to wake up
I didn't like you
but we were brothers forged in the crucible
our eagle globe and anchor made us family
but now as I am staring down death himself
who commissioned the hate of an entire country to do his work
I miss your gunfire more than I miss you

<|endoftext|>

I hear the swing, reminds me of summer
I used to push you on a seat of rubber
The grins you used to give your mother
The creak back and forth hitting the lumber
As you grew older, we didn't mean to smother
We backed away, enough space to hover
We wanted you to be happy like when you were younger
Was it our fault? We still wonder
To walk into your room, where I discover
Your body still swinging, like in summer

<|endoftext|>

The day that I became a man, by legal definition,
My girlfriend visited a while (Her medical condition
Necessitated birth control - we never used protection).
We talked a while, but due to my erection and affection,
I closed my door with us inside, though this was not allowed.
We knew my parents knew, although we knew not to be loud.
Subconsciously I realized she had been slipping away.
We’d seen each other rarely recently, and so today,
Subconscious me did all it could to keep us two as one.
Mistakenly mistimed the pulling out when I was done.
“Oh, shit,” we said together, but we knew it was okay.
The little tube inside her arm
would keep babies away.
*
Before I left for university she finally said it:
“I’m breaking up with you” in no uncertain terms; I read it
From my phone through tears, asked why, but deep down knew the point was moot.
I lost my heart that dreadful day, and lost my mind to boot.
Arrived at university, but wasn’t really there.
Amid new friends, good weed, cheap drinks, hot girls, I didn’t care.
We still talked some, but I could tell she didn’t really want to,
Then silence came from her for one fortnight after a few. …
*
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief –
She was pregnant; I felt shock, and also, shamefully, relief.
Her parents were traditional; there would be no abortion.
This child would bring our marriage, although practicing extortion.
Financially we would be fucked, but that was fine with me.
My mind instead dwelled on togetherness and family.
(Her arm’s glass tube had broken - in effect was ineffective,
The doctor failed, but my subconscious finished its objective)
We talked one night that weekend and together made a plan,
To somehow get through college, all while doing all we can,
To cultivate the little one; we’d get some counsel, too.
This babe would be our passion – reason for the things we do.
Her good intentions also turned my love into a liar.
She told me that she left me not because she lost desire,
But because she wanted me to have some freedom and be happy.
I believed her, really just because I wanted to so badly.
I was happy at this point, although my freedom was subdued…
We said goodnight, and that was that. Forward a day or two,
*
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief.
My assumption of the child’s health turned out to be quite brief.
Her condition cut the odds[of a successful birth] percent-wise down to twenty,
But twenty’s really not so bad – like two flips of a penny.
I picked up every penny, both for luck and fiscal wealth.
I’ve not believed in years, but prayed and pleaded for its health.
Then she and I talked more – before and then felt quite the same.
We even, foolishly, discussed the would-be child’s name. 
Our lives went on, regardless of this secret that we knew.
Then silence came from her for one fortnight after a few. …
*
The voicemail that she left, left me in silent disbelief.
My optimistic hope had gone, replaced with sorrow, grief.
Her heart was fine, but in her there was one heartbeat too few.
Our little angel was just that; worse still, I lost not one but two.
My happy family of hardship in an instant slashed,
To a melancholy fellow thinking only of his past.
“’Tis better to have loved and lost;” I beg to disagree,
For what I lost I’d not yet got when fate took it from me.

Love is a sticky thing.
Like an oil spill, it engulfs you
coats you, slicks you
It makes it hard to lift an arm,
open your mouth. 

Love is a tricky thing.
Where there should be no more than air,
there is your glow, your aura.
And every move you make,
seems as if it were god-given. 

Love is a quiet thing.
Your laugh is all the music I need,
I hear its every note.
The way it weaves past your teeth,
and is shaped and colored by your tongue and lips. 

Love is a subtle thing.
The sound of your barefoot feet,
the quick glance and little smile.
The way you say my name,
Your way. 

Love is a playful thing.
I envy the wind,
when it gets to play with your hair.
And I envy the grass,
that gets to tickle your dancing feet. 

Love is a momentary thing.
I’d rather spend a moment
whispering through cupped hands,
than an eternity
remembering a long forgotten dance. 

Love is our thing.
I am not yours,
and you are not mine.
We are
You and I.

He stood along the shore and said
I do not miss my home
I do not miss my static life
I know I'm built to roam. 

He stood in the abyss and thought
I've never been alone
I've always had my heart with me
It's no one's but my own. 

He stood atop the clouds and yelled
Triumphant as the sun
I know the darkness fades to day
I know my heart has won. 

He stood falling, flailing, endlessly
He'd always been alone
He knew what he had said was false
His heart had turned to stone. 

He woke, he saw no helping hands
Expecting just as much
Tempting, cursing, denying death
Refusing any crutch. 

He stood once more no strength remained
His soles and soul succumb
His heart of stone lay shattered, still
His song a beating drum.

How do you find love, 
And survive the maze?
For love is complex 
And leads many ways.
The maze is full of 
Circles and dead ends. 
Two may enter a pair 
But part as just friends.
Some spend their life 
In search of the center, 
Desperately looking, 
Ignoring others who enter.
Some searchers give up, 
Saying there's no end at all. 
Only more circles and turns, 
It's just wall after wall.
Indeed there's no end. 
That's the trick of the maze. 
It seems we've been lied to 
By the stories and plays.
True love is not found, 
It lies in your heart. 
We search for an end 
Which we had at the start.
There's no need to search, 
So stop worrying too. 
Just open your heart 
And let love find you.

<|endoftext|>

Do you show empathy for others?
Have you been having a hard time
Waking up?
Does it sometimes feel
Like you are brain-stuck,
vaporous
Rapidly expanding
Pushing out the indents in your skull?
Is your head occasionally
Plotting against you?
Do you suddenly want to
Kill yourself at
Three in the morning?
Where do you go
When you get stir-
crazy?
How many cigarettes are you 
Smoking
To numb the buzzing behind
Your eyes?
Who are you letting
Fuck you until you bruise?
When was the last time
You called home?
*
Now,
pick the romance movie
that best describes
You.

I know that smile
I know what it means
I am aware of the nervousness
that comes along with it
the rosiness of the cheeks
the sweep of the hair
I know that smile
and the happiness it yields
to feel love again
for such time so absent
I know that smile
for when you look at me
I cannot help but have it myself
you see,
I know that smile
And throughout the days
as I long to see it again
I know it is futility
For I know that smile,
And as I know that smile,
I know it has never been for me
But for him.

Every morning I order a double americano
(So refined!)
and a fresh pastry,
(How continental!)
and write poems about The Coffeeshop Girl.
(He's probably writing a novel...) 
The Coffeeshop Girl and I are in love but we're both too shy to admit it.
We tell each other in subtle ways.

I say things like "Good Morning," I smile. I leave a tip.
She says things like "the usual?" and "Have a nice day!". 

I sit by the window behind a notebook and thick frames. Another notebook with thick frames sits at the counter, more thick frames with laptops sit at tables.

They say things like "Good Morning," they smile. They leave a tip.
She says things like "the usual?" and "Have a nice day!".

We all order double americanos.
(So predictable!)
We all eat the fresh pastries.
(How cliché!)
We write all poems about The Coffeeshop Girl.
(He's probably just like the rest...) 

We're all in love
with The Coffeeshop Girl.

I’ve built cemeteries on skyscrapers
using only grave mistakes,
and the knowledge that if I fell
I’ll be returned straight to the scenes of
crimes I’ve implicated myself in. 

I stopped long enough to hear somebody
compare people to teeth, and I begged
internally
to be considered a maxillary canine.
I don’t have the roots. 

The streets glistened with dew-covered
people, singing what they thought.
Everybody had a map in their pocket,
they ran their fingers along in the creases
and found distinctions in the dark. 

I lost my co-ordinates years ago.

All I ever wanted was candles on a birthday cake.

I am not a great man.
I am not great.

I have conversations with you
in my dreams.
Did you know that?


But then I wake up
and here I am, and there you are.
Not here, but there.


Not here.


We don't talk anymore
when I'm awake.
But you already knew that.


So I go to sleep.
And here you are.
And here I am.


And I don't ever want to wake up.

The morning began with coffee and toast
And browsing the web for news
The world was a veritable hotbed it seemed
Of geopolitical feud

An emptiness sat at the table beside him
Silently calling his name
A hole in the shape of a red-headed woman
Who Jesus had taken away

He put on his shoes and buttoned his buttons
And scratched at his labrador’s ear
Then lowered his head and stepped into winter
That Thursday of his forty third year

Nobody owes anything to anyone,

If I had God's phone number
The first thing I'd ask is, "wait how did I get this number?"
But the first thing I'd ask God is, "what's up with Jaden Smith, like really?"
And the second thing I'd say is
"Thank you for Emma Watson. Heart eye emoji..
<|endoftext|>
See, if I had God's phone number, he'd probably block me
Because I'd ask him things like
"So, is me having super powers off the table" or
"no seriously, what is up with Jaden Smith?"
I'd ask him
"How many hail Mary's until you make Pokémon real" or
"How's the signal up there in heaven? Because I don't think you've been getting my messages"
If I had God's phone number I'd send him things like
"Thank you for making sure I didn't die in my sleep" or
"Did you make it so that humans couldn't fly for a reason or were you just being a jerk?"
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him "where are you?"
Because things aren't too good down here and I think we may need some divine intervention
But everyone keeps saying you have a plan
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him what that "plan" was
Because I hear a lot of people talking about it
I'd ask him if diseases and natural disasters were really necessary
I'd ask him where in this "master plan" he managed to fit racism and hatred
I'd remind him of the massacres in his name
I'd remind him of the Crusades, people set aflame because their faith was different
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him if it was hard to condemn his son to death to absolve our sins only to have the world end up like this
I'd ask him, from father to son why some kids have to grow up without parents that love them
I'd ask him why some kids have to grow up without parents at all
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him if there was a "plan b"
Because obviously "plan g-o-d" isn't working
I'd ask him to bring back Michael Jackson because the world needs something to smile at
I'd ask him to make sure Beyoncé never dies because we need someone to look up to and apparently, its not you
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him if those spiteful lines of scripture on those angry peoples picket signs actually mean anything
I wonder if those bible verses were meant to sound so violent
I'd ask him if what they're saying is true because if it is, your unconditional love comes with an unconventional contract
I'd ask him "how can you be all loving with so many exceptions to your own rules?"
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him "do you even believe in us?"
Because maybe there's a reason we aren't feeling your love
Y'know, I'm starting to think the rainbows you put above our heads are just empty promises
If I had God's phone number
I'd ask him where he was during my depression
Why he watched my recession toward death and did nothing about it
I lost track of how many messages I've sent to him that could've been my last words
But I can count how many replies I've gotten on less than one hand
If I had God's phone number
I'd call him to ask "did you really need to take my best friend so early?"
"Just make sure he's in a better place now because I don't want that red line across his neck to be for nothing"
And, I've made that call before
But I got sent to voice mail
If you had God's phone number
I'd tell you to not bother texting him
I'd tell you to delete it
Because I've had his number for a while now
And I've sent all of those messages
I think God might be out of service
So I sent him one more message saying "I don't think I believe in you anymore"
"Read at 3:21 am"

There once was a boy, an innocent child
Whose heart was filled with dreams
He dreamed of love, success, and joy
Mountains, green pastures, and streams.
He had no fear for the world was kind
Or so to him it seemed.
But as he aged, he found the truth
And saw that it would mean
An end to love, success, and joy
Mountains, green pastures, and streams.
Instead he was faced with horrors untold
And nights he filled with screams.

You died today,
I don't know what to say.
Our bed is just how we left it
And your winter boots are still in the doorway,
Your car is covered in snow and will be moved tomorrow. 

You died today,
And I don't know what to say.
Your phone still works, I called it today
I watched your phone vibrate on your night table,
I saw the picture of me you would see every time I called you. 

You died today,
There is nothing I can say.
I am lost in our home looking at what was.
Last night's supper still waits for you on the table...
The last time we touched, I was angry at you, and I'm sorry.

The whole city's on xanax.
Thanks, 
what's-her-face.
Let them rain from the sky
like little 
memory thieving smarties
with their 
Easter egg colors.
We'll catch them in our hands
and stuff them in our mouths
until
we've lost track
of how many,
and "Where's my phone?
Someone call it.
Be quiet!
Guys!
Shut up!
Ok, got it."
We said,
"We'll be there in,
like,
fifteen minutes."
But we never left
cause,
"Sam is fucking 
Rachel,
and she's too barred out
and he doesn't want to go anymore
and he was our ride,
so.."
We'll try again 
tomorrow.
Won't we?

Postmodern poets,
pontificating profusely, 

Writing modern lovesongs on iPhones,
Standing in line waiting for coffee, 

Writing constantly back and forth,
back and forth,
Back and forth. 
Sending their poetry onto the world
Instantaneously, At the tapping of a screen. 

Not waiting to take breath,
Nor ink to dry,
Never posing the question
“why?” 

Never stopping for revision,
No contemplating,
Or indecision, 

For there is no time.
No calm.
No peace. 

No rest.

A lakeside sunrise like blood in the water  
Half hearted musings of meaningless slaughter  
Lifetimes of heartache and wasted ambition  
Carelessness curses the human condition

From handgun of virility
Come soldiers of fertility
Agile paratroopers of sex
Meet stifling kleenex

Fuck a love poem
It's easy to do when you're enamored 

Just say the grace of your face
caused my heart pace
to elate at an alarming rate
and inspired a lust
only you can satiate
It must be fate. 

But when the honeymoon ends
and the mask falls off
It's much more difficult
to do more than scoff
Because after eleven months
when you gave it your all
you're told to fuck off
and find out you were nothing
but a glorified booty call 

Fuck a love poem 

Once her heart switches its beat,
everything you once did as a treat,
now are things that made you a creep
and suddenly everything that once was sweet
is now clingy
and the only way to win
is to admit defeat 

So I bite my tongue
And grate my teeth
Because I know underneath
the cleverly constructed guise
lies a beast
And within me,
the power to arrive at a future much better,
and in you,
terrible; down to the letter. 

Fuck a love poem 

I'll miss what you were,
not what you are
Because now I know,
There is darkness
Within every star

<|endoftext|>

How sad it must be, to be one less than infinity
Knowing that you are so close, yet so far from free
By leaps and bounds, striving towards the impossible
Knowing that your chances are simply improbable
How sad it must be, to be one less than infinity

Unending linchpin Practiced repetition Interrupting the process Is not my intention

Hair suspended by gravity Its cessation a tragedy One scratch creates the whole I cannot grasp the brevity

Creating by memory Every stroke symmetry The product of her conscience All sensory

Ive never contemplated beauty until i met you. 
Things were either beautiful or they weren't. 
Beauty was categorical; it was subjective.
The beauty of a rose and that of a child’s laughter were two very different draughts that drew from the same wellspring…
Today, i fear- ive lost all sense, all meaning and understanding of the word. 
I sit here dumbfounded as a child on their first christmas and as in awe as a zealous man witnessing his god.
It’s as if the sun and the horizon met and set in your eyes. 
If your feet ever touched the floor, i find the sky would grow unbearably jealous of the earth 
and -in it’s unfathomable sadness- its tears would drench the land; its wails exclaiming themselves through booming thunder.
And every day… Every moment that came before you ceases to be. As if your presence rewrote my entire existence.
I fear that time and space no longer matter. 
Nor fear of death itself.
There only exists you. 
And i. 
And the deafening silence between us

<|endoftext|>

The first time that I saw you, I was stuck in states of wonder 
I walked up to you seat and told you that you were a stunner
You smiled and gave a napkin and said "you should write your number"
So I took it and signed my name.
The first date that we had was in a diner on a hill
You texted me and said "at 8?" I said "ok I will"
We talked and laughed and afterwards I said I'll take the bill
So I took it and signed my name.
Six months go by and by and you pull right over my heart
You had me at hello, we both knew that from the start
You needed help with money, asked me "can you sign my card?"
So I took it and signed my name.
A year goes by and for a time I really felt at peace
You took me to your parents and I met your aunt and niece
So then you took me by the hand, said "you should sign this lease"
So I took it and signed my name.
Now 8 months pass, there's nothing better that I have in life
You keep me on my toes like I'm dancing on a knife
The paper comes and then it says "will you be man and wife?"
So I took it and signed my name.
Then suddenly one day, we fell apart without a clue
We're talking less and laughing less and keep on feeling blue.
Get the check, by myself, at a table set for two, 
So I took it and signed my name.
Two years went by, we drift apart, you've someone on the side
You keep it low but girl I know, you have nowhere to hide
He showed up soon, with a divorce, then asked "could you please sign?"
So I took it and signed my name.
I guess we just fell out of love, were never meant to grow 
It's now awful silent in my house here all alone. 
And in my mind, I saw a list of guys you used to know
So I took it and signed my name.

I'm going to die

Course, pumping, blood will drain  
rise into space
laced with cocaine 

My beds in the corner
Maybe
I can't see well

It's grainy

I think I'm lazy..
Or crazy.
A buzzing
Hornets nest
Over poignant daisies. 

Okay, no bed...
I feel warm fingers
Of copper carpet 
Massaging my bare breasts 

My teeth ache 
I'm grinding them. 

I'm going to die alone 
As someone's best friend. 
I'm frothing, seizing 
Right behind them 

Nope
Not my problem. 
You need consciousness 
To feel,
To read all of this. 

Before you were born
Remember anything?
calm down 
It's the same thing

Happiness: clothing 
Worn for others approval 
Comes off when alone 

<|endoftext|>

I am a solitary swimmer,
In a deep, dark sea
The light; a glimmer
The surface I see. 

I am eager for breath,
But a twinge of worry -
for missing the depth,
And so I tarry. 

For though I have long drowned,
my eyes and ears have fallen,
on such creatures and sounds,
of intrigue and and color; blues and browns. 

Will the surface suffocate me,
as much as this sea?
I don't want to lose the feeling,
of floating in thee; 

Sadness
Longing
Ache, and hurt
Have driven me to love,
And given birth 

To a drive and desire,
for things so true;
Compassion and love,
I feel for you -
All. 

The light grows nearer,
Steadily they fade,
I begin to see clearer,
Goodbye, should I say?

like watching a man walk out of a grocery store
with one rose in his hand and wondering
what it’s for—a contrition or a gravestone
or just because. this is just because.
this is the romance sold at every corner
and thrown away by the end of the week.
am i wooing you yet?
lean in and smell the perfume:
this smells of vivacious verbs and active adjectives,
a syntactic aphrodisiac leading you
to the friction of fingers on a keyboard.
how many of these until you fall in love?
if i bring you a dozen roses,
will you call me an inspiration?
or would you prefer a handwritten letter,
the kind that rhymes
at the end of all the lines
and each swirled ‘y’ mimics the curls
of my imaginary lover’s hair (poetic license,
you see, because sex still sells.) dear,
this reads like bleeding desire and burning longing
and passing a kidney stone because
writing is equated to emotional dialysis
and everybody thinks everybody else
wants a bag of their word waste.
and the honest-to-god truth
is that writing is a relief
but too often it reads like
you took a piss on my porch and sighed.
if the petals you dribble over my bed
are rotted through, plucked from a bouquet
you threw out two months ago,
don’t expect kisses in return.
because roses? they reek.
and this is a fucking cliché.

<|endoftext|>

Teetering on the brink
I crawl on all fours
Down the endless hallway
Closing any open doors 

Friends turn away their faces
Family show pity in their smiles
I crawl forever forward
So many empty miles 

They call out that old saying,
"Take it one step at a time!"
But to a man who only crawls,
steps ain't worth a dime. 

<|endoftext|>

The needle won't reach the record,
And the smile doesn't quite reach the eyes,
And my brain can't reach around,
Why his warmth didn't reach inside.

Now I'm reaching out for answers,
From a boy inside a box
Who couldn't reach the record,
And could only see the stop.

Reaching out for freedom,
He sang a final song.
He floated out of reach-
Drowned his demons in the dawn.

Now we reach for what to say,
When the silence is too strong.
But nothing seems to reach.
Forever is too long.

"This is the worst ginger ale I've had in my life"
I said to the white walls and fluorescent lights
A record-setting breakdown, achieving the impossible
Shooting for the moon and landing in the hospital - 

Picking at the bracelet that bore my name and "21M"
Waiting for a mediocre meal that never even came
Noticing the dirt and grime covering the floors
I suddenly felt an irreversible shame
The shame
of my roommate escorting me to the psych center
Making sure I didn't walk into oncoming traffic
The shame
of having to explain to my parents that every girl
I ever loved has turned out to be an addict
The shame
of wanting to fuck the therapist, because sex
is the only thing that makes me feel anymore
The shame
The shame, the shame of it all tore
me to bits and the next hours blurred:
Forms.
Urine samples.
Blood tests.
Questionnaires.
Diagnoses.
Discharge.

Words.

I remembered my father's words as I put on my sweater
He said "Son, sometimes life doesn't get any better"
Now it's time, once again, to get it all back in order
Even though heartbreak is waiting just around the corner
The moment you confided in me, my beautiful friend
The truth broke me in half, and now it has to end
And as I sit in my room with the indigo walls
The lights are off and this ginger ale tastes
like
nothing at all.

<|endoftext|>

I'm the friend that walks behind when the sidewalk won't fit three
I'm the burnt out light house bulb that keeps the sailor out at sea
The things I do to feel alive just end up hurting me
And my mind's the only place in which only I can be

Sometimes I'm scared of fear because I know it's in my head 
And my head's a place of dissonance where lonely thoughts are fed
The things I do to feel alive make me wish that I were dead
I'm just a careless keeper of all the words I've never said

But when the clock strikes three am and everyone's asleep
I'll lie awake and dream about the boy I couldn't keep
The things I do to feel alive just make me feel so cheap
The sailor at sea is drowning now in waters fierce and deep

I'm lonely and I'm bitter and I'm rotting at my core
My eyes are windows to my soul because I locked the door
The things I do to feel alive won't be done anymore
I guess I'll just keep living, although I do not know what for

Maybe if the sidewalk widened, or the sailor had more skill
Or if I didn't need to take so many pills
Or if my feet stopped dangling over this window sill 
The things I do to feel alive will come in for the kill

She looked at me and said,
"You should fuck me
before you love me."
And so I did. 
Her hands covered her breasts
and she said,
"I want you to guess which breast 
my father touched first."
And so I did. 
The bones in her hands shifted
as she fixed her hair into a ponytail.
"You're going to promise me that 
you're not going to try to fix me.
You're going to promise me, okay?"
And so I did. 
Her lips would start bleeding 
because when she lied
she chewed her lips.
She said, "I think today 
will be the last day I live."
And I asked her for one more. 
Dry blood sat on her inner lips
as she kissed me good morning. 
Her voice softly cooed, 
"I hope that isn't the last time 
I kiss you." 
And I asked her for one more. 
She bled, 
"All you write about are girls.
You never write about me.
All you write about are faces
without souls. What about my soul?
Are you going to
fucking write about my soul?
Are you going to write another poem?"
And I asked her for one more. 
Looking at me, 
she ran her fingers 
down her hips,
across scars, 
and said, 
"Too many men look at me
and see what they want to.
They look at me and see 
broken picture frames 
that they can repair 
and put our faces into." 
Our hands met 
and our fingers grasped 
at the pieces of ourselves 
that were deeper than faces. 
But it was only me 
as she whispered, 
"Stop,"
licked my cheek
to my ear,
finishing, 
"Don't fall in love
with what you 
think you see.
Just fuck me." 
And so I did. 
And so I asked her for one more. 

<|endoftext|>

You only love me in the dark. 
I only miss you in the light. 
as morning's first kiss peeks your rosy cheek 
your feelings fade away 
and my longing begins to grow. 
like a plant it blooms 
the sun feeds its crimson leaves 
I wait again until dark 
but as light no longer flows into the world. 
it occurs 
you do not love me in the dark 
and i miss you in the always.

The gypsy man plays on warm summer days
And on nights neath a lonesome bright star.
He plucks a soft tune as he howls at the moon
With the song of his Spanish Guitar. 

There’s a bump on a part of this gypsy man’s cart
And it thumps with each turn of the wheel.
It keeps him in time with his plucking and rhyme
As he rides it from Rome to Castile. 

The people all flock as the gypsy cart rocks
And approaches the town from afar,
And they dance to his song as he rolls right along
To the beat of his Spanish Guitar. 

The rich folks will waltz to cheap German schmaltz
And operas are all of the rage,
But the song from the cart has ten times more heart
Than the music of balls or the stage. 

So I rosin my bow and I join in the show
And I sing to the moon and the stars,
But no fiddle can play in the rapturous way
Of that gypsy’s sweet Spanish Guitar.

Dependent and lovesick,
Strung out on a quick fix.
These ideals keep us lifted,
In a smoke cloud, persistent.
Fucking with the same shit;
Drugs are made to be did, kid.
And yes, I know how that sounds,
Ignorant and belligerent.
I keep it real, hedonistic,
Shameless, and overself-indulgent.

The colors are all so vivid,
And the dialogue is scripted.
These life roles, we just fill in,
With some broken down commitments.
Mindset atavistic, 
And a new bag of mixed tricks
That will get me to where 
My next destination lives.
Perched way up high
In the mountains.

Insolvent with the dopeman,
So, weigh the love, buy a gram.
Spent more than 100 grand ($)
On a 15 year old addiction.
Replay the tapes
Sponsored by NannyCam
Caught up in some
Jared Fogel scam.
Residue still on my hands
More than enough for a conviction.

Unwell is an understatment.
Not quite such, the likes of this.
No cures yet, no medicines
For this specific ailment.
Hell-bent for treasures of skin,
New faces and old fetishes.
Tongue in cheek, words of mouth,
Often to leave the lips,
“Old habits die the hardest."
Said the junkie,
Who could never fucking kick it.

i checked again—the lump's still there        
(a manly way to go)
can men even get breast cancer?        
(why are you grabbing your manboob in the first place?)
i was soaping it in the shower        
(you haven't taken a shower in three days)
i rub my nipples when i masturbate sometimes        
(filthy)
i could be a corpse a year from now        
(you're fine. now go take out the trash)
i tried to imagine what oblivion feels like        
(death is the ultimate corner-cutter)
it's not as scary as i thought it would be        
(you'd never have to figure out how the hell a 401k works)
impending death would make my conversations more interesting.        
(never have to get that lumpy body in shape)
i'd never be disappointed by another tv series finale        
(never have to learn what a mortgage is)
never have to attend anyone else's funeral        
(never have to pay taxes)
never regret not making a move on the girl with the outer space leggings        
(never have to update your resume)
seriously, i should've made a move.        
(never have to take out the fucking trash again)
i'd never have to take out the fucking trash again        
(go take out the fucking trash)
i'm busy        
(there's still life in that flabby sack of flesh)
okay, google, can men get breast cancer?        
(the nsa is laughing at you)
sounds like it's rare        
(i'm laughing at you)
still, they're saying i should see a doctor        
(you're fine)
could be a cyst        
(you're fine)
maybe        
(you're fine. the trash can awaits)

her thigh high socks were an rsvp to
a sad book club in the library downtown
where she pulled me down an empty aisle
and cried as she kissed my neck.
we held hands in the world war II section
and she said i was the wrong
kind of idiot and that our days
were digits at the bottom of the page 

february meant we quit the job where we met. somehow it was okay,
and i met her family by accident.
i slept at her parent's house
for an entire week without them knowing.
she laughed when I hid under her sheets
and had to borrow her t-shirts.
i picked flowers from her backyard
and she pressed them in her library books.
her eyes told me the flowers
were better off with her 

she stole some pills from her sister
and we never really slept,
just fell on top of each other in whichever
room we had torn apart last.
none of the black curtains in her room
even had a window underneath
and i wondered if a sleepy cigarette death
would be our only relief that night 

"you're a peach" she said
as i held the door for her. we found
a maintenance hallway perfect for sneaking
into the movie theater after it had closed.
it would be just one of
a hundred binge fog memories that week.
we sat in the empty theater,
second row from the top
surrounded by empty chairs,
barely breathing.
in that vacuum of senses,
she broke her voice, severe as burning books - 

"only an idiot holds himself back
for someone who doesn't mind
being unknowable" 
"don't you put that on me" i sighed
at the shadow of the face i might've lost 

she bit her lip. "i haven't," she lied
and left through the fire exit.

the first thing you will think of will be her shoulder blades
and how they responded in unison to each meticulous
heave and sigh that left her lips
you will stare at the ceiling and think about
how too many times you let
yourself win in an argument.
how, even after your business trips, 
you were too tired to brush a strand of her
hair back or at least pretend to care.
now, you must practice the art of dismembering
pieces of her in the tiny nook set out for reading
and in the colors of your shower curtains
like repeatedly ripping velcro 
off of the heart you thought she would spend
an eternity in.

<|endoftext|>

the way she is now:
twenty-three years and I know people
change, but she changed
from jalapeños and tequila
to homegrown jasmine
and touches of black pepper without
asking me to taste her.

the way she is now:
three months since I last touched land,
held rain, but she changed
from grainy black-and-white polaroids
to sharp neon edges
and evergreen flashes filled with
sparks of the light you can catch when it's
filtered through leaves.

she used to smoke us like a cigarette
between yellowed fingers
and throaty gasps.

she is here, now, unbelievably:
hands newly wedded to clean-cut nails
and a duckling-yellow raincoat
rests at her shoulders.

Wake
Look around
She’s still here

You’re different when you drink

Rub eyes
Deep breath – “Ouch!”
Fuck
New bruise
“Fuck”

You aren’t smart when you drink

Kicked the couch
Last night
She’s right
She's still here

Douchebag

She’s still here 
She bought me beer
Bruised shin; shattered ego
She made me do it

“Are you asleep?”
“No”
“Did I pass out?”
“Yes”
“Are you ok?”
“Yes”
“I’m sorry”
I’m not sorry
“It’s fine”
It’s not

Roll over
Chapped lips
Fuck this 

Fuck you!

She was away
She came back
She brought beer
I drank gin
And vodka
And the beer

I wish you wouldn’t drink like that anymore

I wish too
I wish she
Didn’t make me
Thirsty 
With her souvenir 
That beer
Our fears
Our tears

What the fuck is wrong with you?

It’s 5:30
Too early for me
But now I can’t sleep
I have to pee
I’m thirsty
Thirsty
Always thirsty

I don’t know why you always do this

I dun – I dunno either baby...

But she knows
And I know
She’s thirsty too
She drinks me
I taste like beer
She’s still here

The sunset is caramel dripping down the buildings
And I am willing to bet
That the grass smells nothing like your fingers catching on my cheek when you pinned me down
On the mossy clover hill behind the church last summer. 

I am willing to bet
That this sidewalk is the wrong kind of rough on my bare heels, it must not heat up the same way it used to
That the wind won't blow my skirt up no matter how many times I wear that peach stained dress again.

And you can bet I'd be willing
To take the grimy, soggy train tickets I crumpled in my fist as we ran through the sweaty pink evening just in time to miss the train,
Cover them with orange blossom tea dregs,
Make a sacrifice and summon the gods responsible
For Sunday coming after Saturday and you leaving for school on Monday
And for this lonely fall.

This is my poem to a girl in my class
Who sits and listens with such passionate interest
Overtaken by shyness she never participates
She reads her poetry book and takes notes on her favorites
The person I want to be is shown through her intelligence
Deeply jealous of her, but my love takes precedence
So this is my poem to the girl in my class
In my dreams we spoke for the first time at last
Never will I work up the courage to speak
But in another reality I'm not so fucking weak

<|endoftext|>

Sometimes
I want to lay in be all day
staring up at the ceiling
with the same sad song playing on repeat
and without brushing my hair once
because it takes so much energy to move 

Sometimes
I fall apart
because I spilled water all over the table
and I can’t stop myself from repeating over and over
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
because I’m such a disappointment 

Sometimes
I can’t tear my eyes away
from the razor in the medicine cabinet
and all I can see is crimson running down my ankles
and pooling on the bathroom tile
until I force myself to remember
that it’s not an option anymore 

Sometimes
it feels like my hands will never stop shaking
and my words will never land gracefully,
but instead fall like glass
to shatter on the floor
in a stuttering apology
because I don’t know what else to say or do 

That is not beautiful
It is not beautiful to hate yourself
Or to wish you didn’t exist
It is painful and broken and fucking wrong
not romantic
It is tragic
Not tragically beautiful 

<|endoftext|>

Late into the night
When moonlight filters through my curtains
and my eyes are at half-mast
and my body is limp with approaching sleep
I still feel her hand caressing my hair
And her breath a soft whisper on my cheek
And I almost forget that she’s an illusion
I almost forget the phone call
That shoved a fist in my throat
And made me feel like I was attempting to swallow oceans
The voice that felt like medicinal syrup in my ears
“She’s gone.”
As my body becomes cymbals crashing to the floor
Waves crashing into rocks
Action disintegrating into reaction.
“She’s gone.”
And I wake
With my hair in disarray
Not from hands but from tossing and turning.
Goosebumps encapsulating my flesh
Not from her touch but cool air coming through my open window.
And I remember
The only constant in life is change.

<|endoftext|>

We're together, it's euphoric, a sensation that I love.
A needle sent down to my arm from Heaven up above.
The lows seem unimportant when I'm riding out the highs.
We're together, it's euphoric, I lean back and close me eyes. 

The rush that you provide is always knocking at my door.
You batter and demean me, but I find I'm craving more.
My sanctuary now is the opaqueness of my mind.
I'll leave you when I need to, but for now I'm doing fine.

<|endoftext|>

you were the sea
and i was underneath you

My girlfriend took a train
To go to the St. Patrick's Day Parade, 
With another man. 

She sat next to him,
They shot the breeze, 
I'm sure they grinned. 

They'll go out to the bars, 
They'll have drinks 
and jovial times. 

And I, 
The boyfriend, 
Write this poem. 

I, 
the lonely soul
Write alone.  

The forecast said clear skies,
But there's 100% chance of rain
north of my heart, tonight. 

Let the pagpipes squal, 
Let the party begin. 

I have a heart to collect,
It's been out on the streets, 
thumped by the goose-stepped feet
marching along to my pet peeved beat. 

Damn, another lonely night. 
Damn, fill the upright shot glass. 

The alarm clock will go off with or without her, 
I'll work for something else tomorrow.  

I Hope the boss doesn't ask about the bags under my eyes, 
Or the cavern in my chest, 
Or the picture I won't have on my desk. 

<|endoftext|>

today I finally told her 
in rain-padded silence we walked to my apartment, 
murky New York sky a black shelter above us
void of stars, filled with lights
on the doorstep my eyes flickered like subway brights 
as she leaned down to kiss me 
because she was taller, and I wouldn't 
as my fingers went numb, she smiled and 
held my face as I whispered, 
"goodnight"
and her skin left cold hand-shaped prints as 
the creak of wooden boards left beneath her
shoes and she sung into the night 
"goodbye, love, goodnight" 
and my frozen lips whispered 
"alright, death, sleep tight." 

<|endoftext|>

I said it but I don't believe it
How could I really want to die
We all have pain inside but everyone else seems to get by
Why can't I
Without getting high
Without getting down on myself
Wishing I were someone else
Without ingesting these chemicals to fill my head with instant miracles
Epiphanies lasting no longer than a day
False hope that I have found my escape
I once cried out for someone to save me
Now I simply call out for sympathy
Instead of being made to feel bad
For feeling bad
I didn't choose to be sad
I'm not a magic man
I can't just wave my fucking hand
And suddenly be happy again
These thoughts slither around in my brain like a snake
Eating away at my will to get through each day
Eating away any thoughts of resolution
My mind is polluted
Like the air in my city
And just like my city
I want your pity
But not your solutions
Because I rely on my pollutants

<|endoftext|>

I kinda wanna 
go to the loony bin --
Lobotomy Land
for the barely there.
Bridgewater State 
with smoke breaks
and mattresses,
matching yellow
ottomans and cell service 
too. But life's alright
despite the fits --
I just don't wanna die
like Sylvia did.

Someday I'll tell you a funny story
About how getting lost with you one afternoon made me feel like I was exactly where I needed to be
That when you held me and eased my childish fears after a long night of drinking, it felt like love
And when I woke to find you asleep a full 12 inches away, I wished it was a different kind of love

Someday, I'll talk in detail
Of how, for a while, you were my home
I'll let you in on how the thought of spending the rest of my life with you seemed—for a moment—blissful
I'll make you understand that when you kissed me behind my ear and we said our goodbyes, I felt a lump in my throat and the beginnings of a chronic homesickness

Someday is not today, tomorrow, or the day after that
Someday, should it exist, is when we have settled comfortably into our lives and our arms are home to different people
When there are too many things standing in the way of us acting on our whims
When declarations of former non-platonic love can do no harm

Someday, we will sit intimately as old friends do
Exchange pleasantries and engage in a little playful arguing as we have always done
And when I'm sure all other stories have been told, I will ask you if you have time for one more

<|endoftext|>

Remember when you asked if you could kiss me? 
The light in my head went off.
We broke the barrier of friendship
and for the first time in a long time I felt hope
I guess my hopes were too high
When I realized 
You were still hers.

Remember when you threw yourself at me? 
The animal in my guts roared. 
We broke through the door to my bedroom 
and for the first time in a long time I felt passion 
I guess there was too much passion 
Because I forgot to ask if 
You were still hers.

Remember when I put a stop to this?
My conscience betrayed my needs.
I broke off whatever you want to call this
and for the first time in a long time I felt guilt
I guess there was too much guilt
Because I hated that
You were still hers.

Remember when we pretended we never had that conversation?
My body overtook my mind
We broke the promise to stay just friends
and for the first time in a long time I didn't care
I guess I didn't care too much
Because I didn't bother asking if
You were still hers.

I know it hasn't been long but:
Remember when you fell asleep in my bed?
You're still sleeping there now
I broke off alone to go and think
and for the first time in a long time I feel content
I guess I feel a little too content
Because I finally know that
You aren't still hers—

—But you aren't mine either.
And maybe you never will be.
Maybe you're only using me, but I need you to hear this:
I know I'm nothing to you but
You make me feel alive
Even if it's all a lie.

<|endoftext|>

The sight of you left me gasping for air
The way you smile, the way you glare
Back when I didn’t know what you had in store
To hurt me more
Hurt me more

I was reunited with this old feeling
And briefly, actually thought I was healing
But you merely thought of love as a chore
So you’ve hurt me more
Hurt me more

I told myself this wasn’t fair
While you sat there playing with your hair
I thought I felt better calling you a whore
But it hurt me more
Hurt me more

It’s been so long since I’ve been afflicted
I think the pain somehow got me addicted
So even though we’ve done this before
Hurt me more
Hurt me more

<|endoftext|>

These days 
there seems to be,
an overpowering
oddness of being
overtaking me.

And life, 
this life, 
from its turbid view,
through blemished glass -

It seems as if life 
is traveling past
unbelievably slow, 
so unbearably fast.

And time, 
our time,
seems little more 
than a shifting shape
in swirling smoke. 

Yesterday, like a faded memory.
Last year, like the other day.
Now, like forever.
Tomorrow, like today. 

Nights, 
have lost their glow.

Days,
now fade to black.

And this, 
my untethered existence, 
drifts on, 
at a snail's pace, 
on a swallow's back. 

<|endoftext|>

I wrote your name and signed the letter,  

Finally told you how I felt and though I thought that I'd get better  
I cannot seem to calm the tides that crash so violent on the sides of my mind  

Set sail for endless nights,
Sit still but tremble on. As the night leads way to dawn.  

I cannot bear the thought of breaking,
Losing hope I grab the rope but now my hands wont stop their shaking.    

And though I tie and hope to die, I will hang on until you're gone.
I will wait patient for the dawn, the mast has fallen through the deck, the water rises to my neck.    

And it comes back and through and over you, the feeling of despair.
I try to plead with you and breathe for you but gasp I do for air  

And right before I really lose it
Before I come undone  

I beg the sky and moon and trees that soon my death may swiftly come    

Oh how you've snared me with your vines I cannot flee thee
Let me go, I ask; Oh darling wont you free me?  

I cannot live without your love so looking down and then above
The waves they crash and roar and shove  

I spot an exit on the deck,
I wrap it tightly 'round my neck  

I've carried on and now your gone
I waited patient for the dawn  

I tie the noose as I lose hope
Still hanging on, but by a rope

she had a sweet face and
a pitbull mix in her one-bedroom flat on
holloway road.

she bought overpriced skinny cappuccinos
instead of paying bills and
rejoiced on fridays
expensively without a care for
the dirty laundry graining the bare boards
of her bedroom floor.

she had a couple of lovers
who took shifts licking her downy
cunt and soft belly with a slight snail trail
that faded at the belly button.

she took hundreds of photos on disposable
cameras which she flung in drawers
to be forgotten,
small moments of past lust and
ordinary pleasures
neglected for the present.

she had freckles on her left shoulder but
never on her right and a
small tattoo on her ankle done (badly)
by a friend on a whim.

she painted abstracts on her shower curtain
with hair
that fell out as she washed,
and left them there for visitors to cringe from.

she felt small annoyances and laughed
with strangers (what a time to be alive
and you wouldn't have seen this when we were young),
drunk in pubs at sunday brunch
with a weak london sun attempting to breach
grimy windows.

We are a new generation of writers.

We traded Hemingway’s whiskey
for Red Bull and Vodka,

Thompson’s acid caps
for Chinese research chemicals,

Stevenson’s cocaine
for pure MDMA,

(in hopes of reconnecting to the
emotions we lost in the digital abyss).

Forgotten history to us is the struggle to
capture the American Dream.

Like pre-drone wars, it was
dead before we were even born.

Something was lost to us though – the tangible.

We have no earthy connection, patriotism - 
no mysterious world to explore. 

We write in abstracts and hypotheticals, 
guessing about a place we avoid. 

So on some cool fall nights,
when my eyes tire from the glow of screens,

I take a pen and a leather bound book,
pour a glass of fine bourbon,
buy a pack of the strongest cigarettes,

and write about things I often forget
like the fact that smoke tastes good
and e-cigs provide no warmth.

<|endoftext|>

Sometimes when I get too stoned
and I don’t trust myself to remember things
I’ll text them to myself
little snippets of my mind to read the next morning.
And this is how I end up with texts like
“Snoop Dogg making sushi”
or “the dark pit or remembrance”
pretty deep stuff, I know.
Last night I was up late
blissfully out of my own mind and
This morning I awoke to find
a text from myself that read: 


Loving you again
feels like coming home

Vigorous Springfields
Speak their stories of sorrow.
They tell of martyrs they've made
In the past, present, and tomorrow.

They spin their thirty caliber yarns
In towers, trenches, and lofts.

Accounts of the morose,
Notches of shallow victories,
Revelations made in oppressive solemnity,
Fruitless victories against nameless foes.

Father, Vater, Père, Pater.
Mr., Sir, Sergeant, Private.
All lost for a worthless cause.
After all, rifles cannot distinguish between

The rows upon rows of nameless foes.
All they know is what they've been told;
That war is peace
And peace cannot be gained without war.

i wanted to put you in my pocket
and pretend you were a coin
i would roll you around
among the lint and spent
candy wrappers
until you had warmed to my touch
i would let you out
sometimes
to see the sunshine
and for me to gaze upon your faces
but i never told you any of that
who pretends
to put people
like coins
inside their pockets
that is creepy
instead
a real quarter
i keep in my pocket
dances on my fingers
as i watch you
play with your hair
i do not think you see me
though you are talking
right through me
something about
scott flanders
and his new truck
no
you never saw me at all
this is why i like coins
they are small
small enough to hold
and they warm to the touch
if you take care of them
they never leave

He slips out of bed and quietly gets dressed,
tries not to disturb the young girl at rest.
His breath reeks of whiskey and cheap cigarettes,
he turns and sighs softly, heart full of regrets.
Another night wasted on a girl with no name,
the affection was real, but just not the same.
The walk home will be long, but he takes it slow,
as his house is not home he'd rather not go.
Sleep will be restless, it may not even come,
he'll probably just sit with a glass of straight rum,
tortured by memories of her smile and glow,
for his heart still belongs to the girl that said no.

<|endoftext|>

A man sits alone
in the place he calls home
and he sits in his chair and he weeps

A tear in his seams
Has wounded his dreams
And upon him, slowly, death creeps

He’s not broken yet
But he can’t forget
How he pushed all of his loved ones away

And now he can tell
That in this living hell
That he’d wishes he’d just let them stay

Now see the blood drip
From his fingertips
As it pools at his feet on the floor.

He’s fought for so long
His defenses are gone
And he can’t fight alone anymore

And the pieces he’s lost
What his choices have cost
Have torn his conscious to shreds

His own mind betrayed
Wants not to be saved
So alone, there he sits, until dead.

<|endoftext|>

My phone is dead
My ass is stuck to the seat
Hands and feet fell asleep
Pins and needles, pins and needles 

Put on some fancy clothes
Look better, feel better, be better
All dressed up and no where to go
Everything is a fucking joke 

There are seven habits of highly effective people
I can't even get out of bed on time
There are seven habits of highly effective people
Getting drunk on your lunch break isn't one of them

"Milf Alert!" Johnny said
As I'm lost, floating through my own brain
"Dude", he said, as if it were my name,
"Look at the ass on that one."
As a woman, in her mid-30s,
Blonde hair, pony tail, yoga pants,
Bends over to tie the shoes of her obviously autistic son.
'
"Yeah man, nice." I say as I try to find my way back
To my familiar, cozy, melancholy haze
"It's just this place, is just fucking loaded with talent, dude."
"There's the yoga place, right next door."
"And like, only chicks who care about their appearance come
here, right?"
'
Looking into the cereal aisle, Johnny continues,
"I should apply here. It's probably less money than Mack Shack,
but Jeeezus Christ, look at all this talent."
The woman in front of us struggles with the weight of her
bags,
A shade off from perfectly matching the ones under her eyes.
She's bald, you can tell even though she wears a cap,
Chalk-white and half-dead,
Rail thin,
Weak - you can just tell.
I saw her five minutes before, carefully studying the ingredients of her seaweed salad.
I'm rooting for her to make,
But she glances back at me with a look
That tells me she won't.
Johnny asks me,
"You know who's probably fucking great in bed?"
He answers for me, "Ava. She's a yoga instructor now."
'
There's a long silence in the car until Johnny interrupts,
"What's the point of fucking roses?"
"They're expensive. They just die."
"You look at them once, go 'Oh, that's nice'"
"And then you throw it in the trash."
He laughs.
"Just sticks with thorns", I say.
He laughs again.
'
"Watch where you're going, you just almost ran over that
Mexican lady and made me spill your... quinoa... you faggot."
I nod.
I miss the turn a minute later.
"Shit can't you see."
"Just zombies bro, everywhere I go."
He laughs again.
'
We went to the bar later that night.
Johnny killed it with every girl he talked to.
It was really an amazing thing to watch.
I sat on my stool and barely blinked as the whiskey seemed to refill itself.
A girl much younger than I came up to me and asked,
"Why do you look so sad?"
I forget my response, but it was something witty and she laughed.
I had sex with her that night,
And then never talked to her again.
I told my girlfriend several days later and she broke up with me.
Last week, I sent them both a dozen roses,
Anonymously.

One day I stretched out both my arms
And cupped my hands like so;
And quick, just like a dragonfly,
I pulled the sun down low.

It thrummed inside its little jail
And buzzed and murmured too.
And twixt my fingertips, I watched
To see what it would do.

It seemed content to simply be,
And, found that I could not
Return it free and skyward bound.
So, stuffed it in my pock't.

Immediat'ly the world bled grey
And goosebumps pricked my skin.
Each breath, an icecube in my lungs
Despite the glow within.

Frightened, I turned homeward. Home!
I cried out someone's name...
But both my shoes made hollow noise.
Without echoes. All the same.

Beauty's such a finite thing
That's lost when it is won; 
There's just not enough to go around. 
But look...!
I caught the sun.  

<|endoftext|>

I knew you once

you'd reach behind your ear
to keep your wayward hair
while I would sit, bear witness
say nothing, only stare

you'd yawn and curl your toes,
glance to your glaring phone
and in my room, standing there
I'd know who was alone.

<|endoftext|>

and under starlit skies
between swaying reeds
i wait

for a glimmer of your feathers
wings dipped in moonlight
darling, we used to tiptoe on

the crowns of the tallest trees
but there was blood in the silk
and we could never be

i could not blame you when
you grew wings and flew away
my crane wife

<|endoftext|>

I wrote a hundred songs
Before I knew your name. 

Not long after we'd met
You'd listened to them all. 

As summer turned to fall
You couldn't sleep at night. 

I wrote a lullaby
And sang it to you soft. 

A hundred songs to ash;
I'd only written one. 

Then one day you left;
The lullaby left too. 

I wrote a hundred songs
And all of them are gone.

<|endoftext|>

“How will I know?”
He asked.

And so I told him,
“When the monsters vacate the space beneath your bed,
And take up homes in our hearts and heroes.
That’s how you’ll know.

“When you hold the knife,
And your mind wanders to ending your life.
When you grow accustomed to it,
That’s how you’ll know.

“And when you can finally read the writing on the wall,
When you see that your dreams are nothing at all,
When you arise with tears already in your eyes,
That’s how you’ll know.”

I could see he was crushed,
So I held him close.

“Don’t be like me,”
I said.
“Don’t dread the days you can’t even see.
Don’t die while you can still breathe.”

Do they still have mornings
in Sacramento?
Will I be able to have,
and feel
a slow time, bright
and mine

I think there will still be
places 
and moments
and regular things. 

I know there are trees,
cause I've been before,
and remember
the river
and floating cotton in the air.

I never worried, 
about the Sun in Sacramento,
I knew it was there,
and somehow knew
it would always 
be waiting
if I ever came back.

And people 
will be there too.
After twenty years I hear 
how I talk, 
when I hear them.
The subtle inflection 
feels like a key

Some, when I meet them
will feel, with weird feelings
like parts of myself I have 
been avoiding

Some will feel
like the Sun
and others 
like new parts 
I forgot

Is this the land of great resource be found?
How tall the pines and strong the maples rise,
O'er fields of grains that moor the fertile ground,
And mighty mountains pierce the western skies.
<|endoftext|>
Oh, should we place a thousand ships to sea,
To cast their nets and pluck the endless cod,
The salty depths would still more gracious be,
Till pious men fatigue the ears of God.
<|endoftext|>
But blessed lands repay with blood from men,
Oh how their lustful yearnings must be filled.
They turn their might to loose the sword again,
And blight the land as blood and tears are spilled.
<|endoftext|>
The rightful heirs have paid for hallowed lands,
And mourn for us the blood still on our hands.

Rhythmic movements, 
Like a fast-paced dripping tap
That he turned on as he wished.
Me following, pretending I'm experienced in this.
Everything forgotten by me as it happened, 
Everything forgotten by him as he left. 

<|endoftext|>

Who was it?
I think I deserve to know
who told you love looked like shattered shards
of beating flesh and broken bones protruding. 

Who broke off pieces of your life, one by one,
slowly peeling you back,
layer by layer,
until you were raw and exposed and
said-
"this is how it ought to be." 

Who taught you to destroy things out of compassion? 

Who wrote anger in your eyes
and signed it
"I love you." 

I deserve to know-
you took pieces of me after all-
How can I dress my wounds; how can I
explain my bruises;
how can I convince myself that
love does not speak from angry eyes
if I never know who the author was.

David Bowie died thirteen days
after I sat next to my grandma
while she slowly did the same,
and my aunt said she wanted
Space Oddity to play at her funeral
and I could only ask:
Why not Golden Years?

Only seven since the winds and glints
hovered around her headstone
and raised some disagreement:
A thousand gusts chilled the bone,
yet that afternoon our pale gold
Sun had brightly shone,
and Under Pressure faintly played
with Freddie Mercury alone.

<|endoftext|>

with my keys in the ignition
idle at the red light
I ask myself
where are my keys
I pull up google maps
and text you
where is my phone
can you call
it can you call me
can you hear me can
you tell by the longitude
of my lexicon that our
latitude has me emotive
like happy
like im dumb enough
to maybe be happy
that im too tall for this
twin sized bed but
there is still room for
everyone who wants
to be in it to little spoon
me if they don’t lie to
me I will like their band
a lot and go to all their shows
and when they do witchcraft
I will profess that I am hexed
and heck isn’t scary if we
both go itll be like doing
drugs when my mom wasn’t
home in the garage we invented
religions and it was so real life
that it cant possibly leave my
mind now bc I cant make memories
like that anymore when I’m trying
so hard to make memories like that

<|endoftext|>

I could tell, 
that whenever I stare into your eyes
And you spill the entirety of the world
into mine, 
That you carry your past on your back.
But I will always remember how
You left the fire
burning inside my heart, 
And left Me to think about how it felt
to fall asleep in someone’s arms, 
and wake up a completely different

Person.

have you ever seen a boy naked?    
really naked  
his ribcage bare and rising like bread beside you  
the hair on his thighs bristling;  
dry, skeleton stalks in gooseflesh Autumn fields  
ribcage falling as he exhales, as his heart pumps blood into breath into life

has a naked boy ever slept beside you?  
two shoulder blades splayed wide as an open journal  
the trench between them littered with freckles, dandelion blackheads, 
pimples and a birthmark cast like a strange parasite  
a scar and battlefields of stretch marks on his bum  
which even then, is lovely in its own way

has a boy ever been naked before you?  
really naked  
has he turned to face you after the golden hours fade, and said:  
“I’m afraid of the world and what it wants from me”  
“The things in my head don’t make sense”  
has he ever laid his forehead into the puzzle piece groove of your chest   
has he let it out, quietly or like the clouds

have you ever seen him naked?  
this boy without clothes or a wall about him  
trembling not from lack of warmth, nor out of shame  
baring his being: his solitary belly button, the yawning thing between his legs,  
the shifting truths and kaleidoscope fears inside his soul  
do you coax them out with a warm, empathic coo  
and as you have seen him, has he seen you?

i remember when i fucked
for the first time 
i was 18 and stick-thin and awkward          
and i didn’t know           
his           

name          
and he stuck it in my           
butt          
and i wished           
it was a cucumber          
and  –  god!          
oh god  –            
i faked an orgasm  –           
i don’t know how a man fakes it  –            
but I wanted to 
finish          
it and run away          

and then there was flore and cathy and hannah and Jessica,          
oh, how I loved Jessica,          
She was rainbows and sunshine          
She read yeats and keats and all that           
horseshit          
but when I told Her I loved her,          
She just said          
that’s so very nice to           
hear,          

and then i got grindr          
he asked          
do you do this often?          
as i followed him to the toilet          
in the bus station.          
i said no, i promise,          

but no one spooned like           
rob          
and no one blew like           
fahad          
and the pill blake gave me put me right in the           
mood          

and then there was erica and charlize 
and and           
and that creepy mustache man          
twice my age,          
and also those two guys          
at the same time.          

and sweet 
Darren          
who didn’t know what 
Drug i was on          
when we met.          
and the week after,          
He called and          
I showered real good.          
I plucked my monobrow.          
I trimmed the beard and also          
elsewhere.          

I rocked up at His place          
dressed up,          
but sobered down,          
and we talked on the couch.          
He looked right into me,          
and then i cried on his bed.          
and and and          
He listened.          
and by midnight,          
when i was done talking,          
and crying, 
We sat in           
perfect
silence.          

i said i’m sorry i've ruined your night           
i should go.          

and He hugged me tight          
in the warmest grip,          
and then He held           
for too long.          

He leaned in and He told me          
i have the saddest eyes he’s seen,          
and i pushed him away          
because i couldn’t           
make love to a          
darren,  

and i wasn’t sure           
why.          

and then Bridget and I          
made the sweetest love          
even though          
she was drunk,          
and even though          
she has a rape           
fantasy,          
and her finger slid,          
into my          
butt          
and the next morning          

she said oh sorry oh sorry sorry sorry!          
you know how I get          
when I get drunk.

what are you,

and my mouth published a rough draft of answers that went yes no i mean kind of but not really i don’t know and i'm still figuring out but not really and i guess i’ve explored a little tiny bit here and there but i don’t think so and i think i'd call it bisexual not gay 
and She said

There is a huge broccoli
Next to my stuff
In the refrigerator

I have to move it then put it back every time I want milk
It has been there for at least 4 weeks already

Who the fuck
Owns that broccoli

<|endoftext|>

It’s 3:00am 
and I should have gone to sleep
3 and a half hours ago,
but instead I’m talking to this guy.

This guy with dead green eyes
and slicked back hair,
with straight teeth 
and long legs.

He gets it.

At least, I think he does;
maybe I just want him to.

He’s a sweet kisser
when he’s sober 
and leaves bruises on my thighs
after a couple beers. 

I don’t mind;

he’s good company and doesn’t 
care that I’m hurting because he 
doesn’t care about much and I 
don’t want to care about anything
at all.

But when we’re in his bed
and he turns away from me,
instead of sleeping 
I connect the freckles on his back,
creating constellations
out of tiny brown birthmarks.

He is beautiful,
and as I trace his skin 
with my fingers,
I feel a little more at home,
more than I have in a long time.

But then he sits up 
and reminds me that he doesn’t care
and I remember that I don’t care either.

I walk home
fighting the crisp autumn air 
and make myself toast 
in an empty kitchen 
and hit my head
on an open 
cupboard 
and all I can see are stars.

There’s a whale,

dwelling in the wishing well of my stomach,

like the universe, a widening plummet,

aspirations shut tight like pearls in clams,

moonlight in my hands,

reminiscing lambent plankton,

whilst wading my inner sanctum,

silver glisten of a hooked dream,

there’s a whale to redeem,

my mind spins the handle,

pulling burdens by the bundle,

the whale out of the wishing well,

to excel there’s a need to expel,

excruciatingly, slowly, out of me, he arcs,

never knew whales were made of a million sparks…

swimming away, melting into the night,

leaving me bathed in light and light.

do you remember the time
we got lost in a rainstorm
and my shoes got so soggy
i threw them away and bought new ones

do you remember the time
we drove to the mountains and it snowed
and i kissed your cold sweet lips
and we defrosted our feet
under warm wool sheets

do you remember the time
i lied
and i cursed myself for being such a foolish man
and i made promises i thought i could keep

do you remember the time
you gave yourself to me
and i took you for granted

do you remember when
we decided to end
the
damn
thing

and i held you in my arms one last time
tears streaming down our faces
and i cursed God
and i cursed myself

you looked at me and asked if
i wanted to end
it
and i said no

you looked at me and asked if
it was the right thing to do
to end
it
and i said yes

for you i said yes

i held you close
i told you that no matter what
i would always love you
you said the same
and you walked out
the door
and i never saw you again

Don’t sleep with a poet.
She’ll turn your thighs into couplets,  The way they wrap around her like twin vines.
spiraling up a brick wall. 

If you invite a poet into your bed,  She’ll carve stars into your palms  So that every caress of yours  Paints constellations across her skin.  Complex enough to make an astronomer leap across her body 

When she kisses your neck, it’s no longer muscle and bone and skin.  She’s turned it into a sonnet of rushing rivers  A-B-A-B  C-D-C-D  E-F-E-F  Where every stressed syllable is a kiss upon your jaw  And the unstressed ones are fingertips sinking into your chest  G-G 

The poet will drag haikus out of your eyes  How they are green like patches of overwatered grass  And tell stories of centuries come to pass.  17 syllables on how you are so young and yet seem ancient like the great kings of old. 

Don’t sleep with a poet.  She will write pages of odes about your mouth on her thighs  And how your lips trail like a comet down her calves. 

She’ll turn you inside out and take away everything that makes you alive.  You’ll forget you were ever anything but words scrawled onto scrap pieces of paper.

I found hell in a gas station in the humdrum slums of farmland California;
In the eyes of the wretched gatekeepers living in the neon hope of the gas prices;
The town of twenty trapped by tilled trenches tasked with too much time;
They wash their cracked hands, their labored faces, their souls for imperfections, but
The dirt never leaves their lungs, their muddy breath forced to cough and croak songs without music.
<|endoftext|>
Under that neon lamplight, mothers bring their children to the flies, like a baptism for the dead;
The children shove their faces into the gas station windows, or else watch the backs of their fathers
Who look onto their land, its illimitable suffering, and roll it up into suicide cigars.
<|endoftext|>
To smoke, to bleed, to wish, is to know the air, the heat, and the emptiness; 
To stare at neon is to know the abyss behind it.

Is this depression?
Is this ever going to get better?
As if people care.

I have literally zero friends and feel like no one is going to love me.
I'm afraid to make friends because they will find out i have no friends.

Someone talk to me please
I got to find a reason to live
HELP ME

How do I cope?
I signed up for counselling today

I don't deserve this. No one does.
All I want to do is scream.

I yelled at my mum today.
I'm really sorry
I'm fine mom.

Having a hard time eating
i think i'm going to start drinking

What now?

She left.
i have nothing to live for
I'm Done

I just...want to sleep
I use sleep to escape

Lexapro?
Zoloft?
Should I expect more side effects?
Please help

My knees quivered
The air was thin
I wanted to jump
Then I saw your grin
You climbed the ladder
To the top of the dive
"Me first!" you yelled
As you pushed me aside
I lost my balance
And fell off too
I was twelve years old
When I loved you
My finger trembled
The lights were dim
I said yes
On a hope and a whim
You were down on one knee
I asked for a kiss
"Me first!" you exclaimed
And so began our bliss
I looked at our future
Sparkly and new
I was twenty years old
When I loved you
My stomach sank
The room was cold
I couldn't die
We're supposed to grow old
You stayed strong
And said I couldn't go
"Me first!" you whispered
As if you could know
It was only cancer
We've got so much to do
I was thirty years old
When I loved you
My body numbed
Everything was silent
Delights and ends
Everything violent
You left a note
Right by the bed
"Me first" you wrote
As you planned in your head
You ended your life
Before chemo round two
I was thirty one years old
When I lost you
Tear it to shreds.

Seven line love poem:
And suddenly the steering wheel jolted
echos of twisted metal and engine failure
flare as the vehicle gyrates across lanes
It takes moments, and then minutes, and then days
to realize what I've done. Sitting at the side of the road
waiting for the cops. Eighteen days since you last called
the greatest thing I ever had lay wrecked. 

Six line love poem:
You told me of the suicidal man
serene
at the mental ward
then you laughed
then sighed
then laughed 

Five line love poem:
anthropomorphically
your voice burrowed
and nestled deep
in my ear
"I think I'm your girlfriend." 

Four line love poem:
Eighteen pills
gastric acid
I can hear your teeth grind
in my sleep. 

Three line love poem:
the outline of ligaments
connecting at your wrist 
made me burn yellow. 

Two line love poem:
Not even the moon
has such a soft glaze. 

One line love poem:
She's gone now.

Kiss me like a stranger
hesitant and questioning
is this okay
shock of hair between your eyes
can I – may I
feathering like fumbled rain
should I stop or

Kiss me like a
brash illicit paramour
no, we can't, we
hurried glances, stolen time
feels so right it
secretly in corridors
we'll get caught for

Kiss me like
rough, behind the laundromat
I need you so
torrid, needful, calloused hands
fuck! you drive me
poolside at a cheap motel
be quick, love, be

Kiss me
like you kiss her.

why so many bobby pins

whose clothes are these in the drawer  
why do you have an iphone cable  
do you think that bench still has your initials on it  

why do you think she cut her hair  
how do her purple highlights always end up in your sleeves  
why do you hold them to the light every time you find one  
don’t you know by now  

what color were her eyes  

what was that for  
what did the wall do  
was that a fucking stud  
are you ok  
can you drive  
how is this my fault  

why was the radio playing Summertime Sadness  
why does the ER have a radio  
what was the point of buying that sweater  
why do you still wear it  
do you think it will fit over your cast  
did they give you a choice on the color  
isn't there enough purple in there  

why didn't you write more  
did she ever read any of your poems  
did you show her any  
when did you realize you could only sing along to the chorus  

is drinking alone easier or harder  
do you find goodbyes to be vulgar  
what do you think you were doing this time last year

We are best friends.
Inseparable.
When only one of us is out, they ask about the missing half.
We spend an unhealthy amount of time together.
Just.
New friends.
Passing time. 

We get new jobs, but we stay close.
Our time together goes from daily.
To weekly.
To "brunch every Sunday"
To "Oh my God, has it been a month? We can't let that happen again!"
We will.
We will have that same.
Exact.
Conversation.
Five times this year.
But we're busy with
New friends
Passing time. 

One of us will call every week or so.
Intending to get together.
We're busier now.
Demanding workloads.
New friends.
Passing time. 

We'll bump into each other at the same local places we used to frequent.
We'll fight over buying the next round, and joke about how
It was so different Back then.
We introduce our new friends and lovers, looking for approval.
The introductions stop.
We hug when we see each other.
Then we wave.
Then we act like we don't see each other, and enjoy our meal with
New friends.
Passing time. 

We see each other's cars around town and.
We wave.
One day, we get new ones.
The waving stops.
Businesses
New friends
Passing time. 

One of us gets married.
We're there.
Sort of.
We shake hands of friends we used to know.
We text our date it's time to go.
We leave the gift we just picked up.
We sipped enough champagne to meet your
New friends
Passing time. 

Congratulations!
We text you on the day your first is born.
We aren't there.
It would have been weird.
What's the baby's name again?
What color balloon do we send?
Families
New friends.
Passing time. 

It's been years.
We see each other at the store.
One of us is just back to visit parents
They're getting older
Sometimes they ask about you.
How old is the baby?
Seven. We're headed to see their
New friends
Passing time. 

Our kids are graduating.
We see each other at the ceremony.
We wave.
The kids ask us who we are.
Nobody.
They run to their
New friends.
Passing time. 

I wonder How they've been?
Sick
Older
Surrounded by family and friends.
Except one.
The kids are looking through your old photos with you.
Who is that?
You read the obituaries.
You almost forgot they existed.
I guess they don't anymore.
You cry at the funeral.
The kids had to ask.
Who was that? 

We were best friends
Inseparable.
When only one of us is out, they would ask about the missing half.
We spent an unhealthy amount of time together.
Just
New friends
Passing time.

Write more please, but say less too; there's
more to say, but not from you. Press
that ballpoint 'til it bleeds for-
saken thoughts and worldly needs.

Words are drugs- a filthy vice. Your
livelihood pays dealer's price. In-
hale the smoke of burning page. A
high produced by mindless rage.

Hollow rhymes you write for sport in
empty lines for school report. Fa-
cade is crumbling I can't do this. 
Sorrow's humbling- won't get through this

Kill me- don't you even try to
kill me as i spew each lie. Just
leave me here to wallow sad-ly
while I line syllables up badly.

Poetry lets me pretend these
awful thoughts are not the end. These 
inklines smeared on reader's heel- these
futile treks won't make You feel.

I reached for my pack  
of reds  
but then I remembered I quit  
awhile  
ago,  

so I exhaled quick,  
shook my head  
and that was that.  

A little later I poured  
a drink  
but then I remembered I sobered up  
a couple months  
ago,  

so I exhaled quick,  
poured it out,  
and that was that.  

Later that night I dialed  
your number  
but then I remembered you quit  
2 weeks  
ago,  

so I lit a smoke  
I poured a drink  
and that was that.

Which postal service can send my picture to outer space?
I scoured up & down I-95
searched in dank alleyways
Because I desperately want all the cosmos
to applaud the clear complexion of my face.
So I stow away & abort this cavalcade.
Immediately before I espied a fable’s end
All because…

They shake their glossed bald heads at the local UPS,
scoff when I suggest overnight express.
Not even the reliable men & women of FedEx
can aid my victory for intergalactic acclaim.

So now the whole space of my stardom is waning fast.
Can’t think of anything better to do…
Except!

Parcel out, bubbled & shrink wrapped,
morsels of my Westside flank,
catapult the bloody mess
over the hovering stratosphere
of Cape Canaveral’s base

Via proviso and prominence,
videotape the effervescent spheres'
kismet as they ski
upwards like fractured dagger tips
to compose a paved entryway
atop the crest of the Raduga K-8.

I’m not a poet. The beer is.
The beer is typing. The beer has
written and deleted six poems tonight.
The beer is cheap. I bought it at 
a rural gas station coming back
from my girlfriend’s thanksgiving.
They didn’t make a lot of vegan
food. I care. The beer doesn’t.
The beer smokes cigarettes. I’m
trying to quit. The beer is a cold
bastard. I cried tonight. The 
beer doesn’t miss my friend
who jumped to his death last
month. I do. Every day. The 
beer has moved on; why can’t I?
And that’s why beer is a poet 
and I’m just a sad drunk - still
coming to grips with suicide.

Step gingerly, one foot at a time   
out of the shower-bath and wrap  
a lone giant fluffy pink towel  
around myself. Steam drifts slowly   
from my body like 8 grams of soul   
departing.   

Peel exactly one sheet of two-ply   
from the toilet paper roll  
and wipe the tri-fold mirror   
up and down with practiced   
squeaks; I wave to my reflection   
and she waves back   
heavily.  

They say at the end of the day   
all a man ever really has is   
his word, and a woman   
her reputation, so my   
face bears the cratered terrain   
of a life's reputation earned   
brutally.  

Morning sarcastically caresses   
each pit, bump and scar on my left   
cheek.  I find I have started to like   
the right half of my face more,   
partially veiled in brief 7 o'clock   
shadows.   

Grasp a hunk of mouse-brown hair   
in my fist and drag the brush through   
the ends. I have no idea if this is   
how you do it; mom never taught me,  
never braided me in pigtails   
or pulled it back in a pony. Never   
bothered.   

Yank through a knot with all the   
subtlety of a boxer, because that's   
what I was trained to do. Fight the   
world, beat it back from the doorstep,   
never give them the upperhand,   
and don't let them see you   
cry.   

Count the hairs trapped between the   
tines. Three, four, five.  No, six. More   
than yesterday.  Pop three pills in   
my grimace and hope for the best.  
Maybe there will be fewer   
tomorrow.

We sit in sacred silence, a captive congregation.
Spines straight, fingers folded,
a plastic smile slashed through each manufactured visage,
nostrils upturned at the lingering stench,
blood and sex and shame.
We suppress the tremors, force our hearts back into our stomachs.
Something seeps from our pores,
pushes from under our fingernails,
leaks from us and mates with the sickly air,
but never do we burst.

I have the bitter praise of jealous men
Who gaze at you and long to take my place.
They stare at me and try to comprehend
What gifts I have to match your love and grace.
"Perhaps she loves him for his charming wit,
Or maybe it's his roguish handsome smile
That hangs upon his body, trim and fit,
With stately clothes of elegance and style."
But I am just a mirror to the sun
Reflecting majesty that comes from you.
If they seek virtues in me, I have none
For in my heart, I know this much is true:
I never knew how perfect I could be
Until you came and gave the best to me.

<|endoftext|>

You are beautiful
And I hate that I love to love you
The mere sight of you makes my heart pound
Pumping hot blood that burns through my veins
Your smile is a drug to me
With a strong high but a week-long crash
Your laugh is a sweet, soothing melody
That slowly falls out of tune
Thoughts of you wrap my mind
Slowly constricting it, leaving it to suffocate
You are perfect, because you are you
And if you wish to be without me
Then that's perfect too
You are the best thing that'll never happen to me

The same old question from the barber,
"How long since you cut your hair?"
I was here five weeks ago
but sat in a different chair.

I sat right here, looked in that mirror
and had a slightly rounder face,
because when I was here five weeks ago
I was in a different place.

I had seventeen more pounds on me
and must have sat up taller too,
because when I was here five weeks ago
I had a different point of view.

If you can take five weeks off me,
maybe take a little more,
because when I was here five weeks ago
there was no blood on Highway Four.

I was still a human being
and he was still my closest friend.
Make me who I was five weeks ago.
Make me who I was back then.

Sweet sorrow
hello again 

I've kept everything
just the way you like it.

there are times
late at night
when people ask me,
with asteroids dripping
from their
pupils:
“what is your favorite constellation?”
and,
smiling in that half-madness
that is so often forgiven as
eccentricity
i say,
“none of them.”
for the stars are mere markers,
their light the sooty silver ash
flicked flames off cindering cigarettes
blazing feverishly in the far alleyways
of the universe, their
smoke
milky incandescent nebulas
breathed by dusty lungs.
but the black in between—
it is time
love
possibility
desolation
and hope.
it is a paradox
that spirals out 
of all possibility
in the forms of
comfort
and fear.
the constellations are mere
latitudes and
longitudes,
lines in a boundless cartography
for the vessels of our imaginations to navigate:
an infinitely black sea
rippling with tides of time,
the arcs of planet’s rings
slicing
into the void like the windswept sails
of the ships of our souls,
the seafoam starlight
rippling at its very ridges,
an inky night ocean
specked with drops of starlight
like static snowfall…
there are times
late at night
when people ask me,
with asteroids dripping
from their
pupils:
“what is your favorite constellation?”

One day I met upon my way
A lovely fox who pranced and played,
In quiet awe I ceased my stride
She stopped as well but did not hide,
Her eyes I held and hers did mine;
So saw the fox and I. 


I dared not move, I kept quite still
And so it was with no small thrill,
She neared to me, arm’s length or less
And did not run from my caress,
Yet she still trembled at my touch;
So met the fox and I. 


Our bond thus made she led me now
I watched her play intrigued at how,
In little things she took delight
Like flowers, trees and other sights,
She taught me much about the world;
So walked the fox and I. 


As we progressed along the path
My stoic self began to laugh,
To watch how charming, how carefree
That lovely creature could now be,
It moved me deep within in my breast;
So went the fox and I. 


Such simple splendour we then felt
As boy and fox on hilltop knelt
And watched the world for some short while
Repose devoid of care nor trial
A quiet place where time stood still;
So knelt the fox and I. 


When came the time to leave again
I bade the lovely fox remain,
For my path led through the unknown
A journey safest made alone,
I could not bear her come to harm;
So stood the fox and I. 


"I promise, fox, you'll walk with me.
For in our time I came to see
That kindred souls will 'oft ensure
Their paths will intertwine once more
It won't be long I promise dear."
So loved the fox and I.

“Yes. A spider. Of unreasonable size, 
yes. I tell you, Matilda, you let these 
little fuckers crawl around and they
think they own the place.”

Groaning fingers stretch out,
striving to reach obsolescence in the
form of a landline home phone.

The click of the receiver 
sounds like a click.
The grimace is an approximate
impression of a smile. 

Gossiping takes practice when
time is never of the essence.
God has not aged well and
is in danger of becoming 
a neo-spiritualist. He wears
glasses like Buddy Holly and
practices yoga. Stay 
flexible. Stay relevant.

we spend our saturdays watching cartoons,
or rather, the cartoonish way everything seems to move,
flashes and glitches like bad programming. 

we wonder if our parents ever felt this way,
chests bursting with a hopeful less-feeling
because the night sky says what we can't figure out how to phrase,
and a fifth of fireball says what we can't bring ourselves to say 

we cut class like the valentines we made in first grade,
decisive but clumsy, eager to learn, and with emotion
spray paint in place of quills, so we can transcribe our novellas
on a broke city's tunnels and halls 

and sometimes there is chaos, within our ranks
we hash things out with facebook and fists
and soldiers have fallen, but we will not forget
bong rips for frankie, give 'em hell kid.

You said that you liked peeling oranges 
Liberating the fragile life that’s been walled off 
I said that it seemed intrusive 
You said that it was satisfying 
That one day you just realize you are an adult 
And you go to work and you go to the store 
And you see all of these people despairingly disconnected 
Desolately walled off 
And you remember the warm embrace of your mother 
And the loving touch of her hands 
And you wonder why that went away 
And you want so badly to replace it 
To be acknowledged more deeply than a passing glance 
And you wonder if anyone else feels the same way 
Then you see a wall 
But it’s different than the others 
And you want to be on the other side 
So your nail scrapes the skin 
And there is an exhalation of vapor 
A burst of luminous droplets 
And it burn your eyes 
But through your tears 
You see the fragile life 
That’s been walled off

and i loved myself

but only

in pieces 

snippets 

photographs

my hair turned the shade of rust

i climbed barbed wire fences to force

myself inside of my head

shut the circuit off

rearranged the wires

i wanted to

start over

fresh like new paint in an old home

i let the moths fly out

shook the drapes

changed the sheets

dusted the platter

i set a new table 

comfortably

for myself inside of my head

<|endoftext|>

So we sat there
in silence
basking
in our own intellect and sophistication
saying not a single word
so as to not disillusion ourselves.

<|endoftext|>

Great again.
Great like ball games
And road trips,
American flags
And church potlucks.
Great like a home-cooked meal at six
Respect for your elders
And actual conversation.
Great like homecoming dances
And the national anthem;
Love for Flag, God and Country,
To thee, I pledge.
Great like soda fountains,
And Drive-Thru movies
The Ten Commandments
And those damn commie bastards.
Great like
The perpetual and proud roll of
White-walled wheels
Before Detroit
Became a punchline. 

Great again like
Living the American Dream
Presented on a
Blasphemy-free beaming box
Of blissful hope
And life-changing appliances.
Great like late-night shows
And Rebels without a Cause
Rat Pack rhymes
And Blues that still had soul.
Great like sacrosanct springing suburbs
With two-car garages
And no bursting bubbles
Of greed, overflown.
Great like the astral aspirations
Of an entire generation
And a race
to the stars. 

Great again like the mad men days
Of slinging a two-bit smile at some broad
And then a slap on the ass as she walks by
Her inner rage subdued
By the echoes of her high-heeled retreat
And practice.
Great like the end of the wife’s
Goddamn nagging
Being found at the beginning of a thumb
Tightly grasping four fingers
And delivered
On the rocks.
Great like choice found
On the end
Of a coat-hanger. 

Great again like the good ol’ days
Of white picket fences, made in the U.S.A.
And white picket neighbours who were as well.
Great like nuclear families
With Nuclear dreams
And a God-given right
To 9mm of salvation.
Great like the annihilation of ancestral abodes
The promise of restitution
Now just pipe dreams and tears.
Great like the right kind over here
And “your kind” over there
Did you hear what I said to you, boy?
Great like segregated schools for segregated homes,
No unnatural unions of this or that nature
None of that devil’s music and improper gyration
No bathroom bills or gender improvisation
All fixed behind closed doors with enforced reformation
To Protect and to Serve just one population,
And helped by the business end
Of a truncheon.
Great like good ol’ boy justice
Served by shrouded mob
And hooded robes
Out of a dusty pickup at 2 am.
They shoulda’ known their place,
In this ‘great again’ nation.

I found my love in ticking clocks,
in children's rhymes, in cinder blocks,
in falling snow and crashing wave -
and I will love her to my grave. 

I found my love in war's deep scars,
in circuit boards, in prison bars,
in sleeping dust and rising smoke -
my soul answered when my love spoke. 

I found my love in kitten's purr,
in fox's squeak, in metal's burr,
in molten glass and depths of space -
still I see little of her face. 

I found my love in raven's wings,
in orange embers, in secret things,
in air's caress and quiet earth -
the catalysts of my rebirth. 

I found my love in Mimir's well,
in Avalon, in Dante's Hell,
in Middle-Earth and Homer's Troy -
and still, I'm no more than a boy. 

I found my love in blues-note riff,
in Bloom County, in Spaceman Spiff,
in beds with legs and mice with bricks -
again, the needle my thumb pricks. 

I found my love in warm caress,
in ordered print, in puzzle's mess,
in lightning bright and thunder loud -
the more I learn, the more I'm proud. 

I found my love in orchards wide,
in emerald hearts, in blushing bride,
in phoenix down and warrens deep -
that which I know, I dare not keep. 

I found my love in trailers small,
in graphite shapes, in teacher's call,
in paper, lined both blue and straight -
and I rejoice, to pass her gate.

I wish you’d up and leave me
I wish you’d up and leave
I wish you
I wish things
Were better for us

We are in the ocean now,
Maya.
Can you see the deep?
Can you see the bottom? 

IV.

I’m drowning in myself
I’m drowning in myself
I’m drowning in her
We’re both
Drowning

There is nothing to comfort you
Except the silence of old graves,
And if you try to listen,
You will hear the sound of things falling.

“Hi! So okay, I know I’m a stranger,
and that you don’t know me,
and I don’t know you,
but very recently I’ve
come to the realization
that the number of people we meet
in this world isn’t nearly
as infinite as we’d think it to be,
and that our lives or this world,
for that matter, aren’t nearly as infinite
as we’d think them to be,
which is why I think it’s so special that,
upon first laying my eyes on you,
I felt that infinitude:
that boundless untick tock 
frozen clock ticking vast vacuums 
of savory saturated seconds,
of crossed legs and eyes the color of undug gold;
soft brown irises blinking etched eternities--
what I’m trying to say is you’re very beautiful!
And to be a hundred percent honest with you,
if I didn’t at least ask your name,
why,
I’d be as bitter as this black coffee!
Ha!”

Mom's curly hair is too busy  
Washing the dishes  
And taking care of the laundry  
To be curly again.  

<|endoftext|>

She told me that all bad people are just good people on a strange path,
and all the saints are just secret keeping sinners, or mediocre folks
who never woke up on the odd side of the road:
Exceptional Evil is only the bedfellow of Ghandian Greatness.
I told her the saints had been such selfish lovers lately.
She said, you’ve got two hands,
do it yourself.

He told me that travel is stupid
because the only thing it can ever teach you is that
everyone is exactly the same
in different headwraps and ways of weaving floormats and bathroom habits
but at the end of every day
All everyone wants is a hot meal a good fuck a stiff drink and a cuddle
to love their spouses and mothers and children
to feed their pets and eat the rest
and get on with it.

They all want to tell me about their Stuff,
how they used to have so much
but now they just want to go fishing
and drink topshelf liquor at thirdworld prices.
They all just want to wear harem pants
and fill their pockets
with the little white seashells
that wash up on the beach in clusters.

We all want to tell about our bad habits,
how we tore them off like bandages and new skin
bloomed underneath them.
Scars are just new masks, I say,
but that is a very unpopular opinion.

When we sneak away into our seashell stashes
we rattle them in our hands
like underwater windchimes
and imagine how they sounded
clattering up and away from the ocean

Some days when I look at the ocean she is a quilt of belonging
ivory infinity folding over and over itself.
Other days she is the silver specter of regret
and a thousand seashells thrown into her mirror face
get gobbled up
with only gagging bubbles
for protest.

<|endoftext|>

When I look into her eyes,
I hear,
“Don’t even bother.
I am the poetry you can never write.”

<|endoftext|>

there's a man sitting on the gum spotted sidewalk,
chewed up and spit out, spit on and stepped on.

it doesn't matter what his sign says.

<|endoftext|>

I order a drink:
It's brown swill,
But the buzzing in the back of my throat, like a herd of bees,
Drowns the sound of my thoughts.
It’s nice to forget. 
Rain and night remind me too much,
So I come here, to columns of filmy light,
Countertops covered in wet lymph,
And people who look like ashtrays
Poking their heads out of the mud
So they may make a wistful glance
At a world that has burnt them. 

This is a far cry from wine in the north of Italy,
Petty mud-water that stares with its greasy eyes,
A little flatfish waiting to seize its prey.
My head nods on the counter,
The vile fish falls and lets out a hiss
As it heaves like a squashed cat,
Its life expunged.
There’s nothing I can do anyways.

She slept enveloped
inside my arms
like a letter,
and like any grand secret
I wanted nothing more
than to reveal her contents
for all of God's creatures to revel in.
So I broke her waxed seal
and climbed inside her language.
I parted the clouds
like the Red Sea
and erased their white masses
with the edges of my thumbs,
careful not to nudge her
from the grasps of sleep.
I wanted to share her beauty
with the Universe-
to take her by the hand
and out of the atmosphere,
to drift by the pale blue dot
we called home and wave,
to refuge on the outskirts of Pluto,
and swing on the rings of Saturn.
So I lifted the glasses
tugging on her ears
and folded them in my shirt.
I picked the litany of freckles
sprinkled under her eyes
and across the bridge of her nose
one by one
with the tips of glass fingers,
and one by one
I drew them back into the sky
as stars for all the world to see.
She did not wake,
but only shifted her head
to fit more comfortably
inside the pocket
of my celestial shoulder,
stirring off further
down the rabbit hole
of another dream.
Now wherever I'm without her,
whenever I look up into the night,
I see her beautiful face
strewn across a bottomless canvas,
and I pray beyond a reasonable faith
she will one day deliver upon me
this same courtesy-
reach down inside my weary bones,
pluck the birthmarks off my arms
and legs
and torso
one by one
like dying flowers,
bend down and kiss away
the constellation of tears
welling up inside the corners
of my tiny smile,
kidnap me from my tiny corner of the world,
and drop me onto the arms of spirals,
into the far corners of the galaxy,
so I can join her forever
in the heavens.

<|endoftext|>

I am the discovered girl,  
a marionette who cut her strings.   
A continent, pristine and pure,  
unclaimed by concrete queens and kings.      

I am the secret whispered bright  
to gods who cannot know – or care,  
A song unsung, an unread book,   
an unheard, desperate, dying prayer.       

I am the mountain, clothed in cold, 
who learned instead to burn like suns –   
A blazing, blissful pyre for  
the cow’ring unenlightened ones.     

I am the paper tyger who  
grew claws to scratch and teeth to bite, 
Who scrapes together meager scraps, 
yet runs from every loathful fight     


I am the quilted, clothwork one –  
a borrowed, patched, and mixed tableau.   
I am the discovered girl;  
that's all you ever need to know.

I stopped wearing bras in high school. And no, I didn’t do it for some feminist statement. 
I stopped wearing them for the exact reason you wouldn’t want me to. I liked when people looked at me. 
I threw away all my Fruit of the Loom packaged underwear. I went to “Romance” stores, and I’ll save you the pain Of describing what I bought. 
You can probably already guess. 
I talked to strange men in strange places. They whispered in my ear all the things they wanted to do to me. 
They whispered into the same ears that you whispered bed time stories to. 
I guess I’m a different kind of princess now. 
I don’t come home much anymore. You stopped calling because you knew I wouldn’t answer. 
I travel around the city a lot. I’ve met a lot people you’d disapprove of. 
I make my own ways of making ends meet. I walk streets with other girls like me. 
It was a normal night. Working in red light. 
A car pulled up beside me and Rolled down the window. 
A familiar voice rang out, “How much?” 
But I guess you didn’t recognize your own daughter. 

<|endoftext|>

I did our laundry yesterday. My face was just as wet as all the Clothes hung up to dry I saw the sweater that I bought you For Last Christmas that I gave you early to see you smile I did our laundry yesterday. I saw the shirt that you wore on the Second day we met I smelled your perfume on your favorite shirt The one that calms me down Better than the meds I used to take I saw my shirt that you had ripped When we were just two kids Brand new lovers killing time I saw the dress shirt I had worn When you told me we’d bring a little Baby in this world I saw the jacket I was wearing When we smiled at each other When she said that “it’s a girl” I saw the clothes we used to buy at the thrift store by your work I couldn’t tell which sweater’s mine I did our laundry yesterday. I did it all real slowly cause It might be the last time I cannot bear to see you go We’re all I’ve ever known And all I’ve wanted in this life I do my best to give you space To take it easy on all of these long texts I send at night But it’s hard for me to face I cannot put to words How I’ve been feeling in this way 
I guess I’ll just say please don’t go I’d give it all I could give just to hear That you would stay But I did our laundry yesterday I couldn’t bear the thought of dividing Yours with what is mine I’ll do our laundry again today Not because it’s dirty I just want to One last time

You once said, 'Sex, is a conversation', Well then I wonder how we'd speak. With muted sighs and tender cries, Or something less oblique? Before the talking starts, I'd take Your shoes and walk your streets, To see if blisters, From our whispers, Whisked you off your feet. You once said, 'Sex, is a conversation', Maybe I'm the quiet type. I'll spin these words but speak unheard, In case you spring to flight. If looks could kill, Then I'm a ghost, Who floats from scene to scene, Just passing through the passers-by, Whose hearts you always win. You once said, 'Sex, is a conversation', If that's the case then I'm all ears, But strings have tripped and tamed my tongue, And I'm no puppeteer. We know that what I write of, Can never be displayed. But if we sat, And had a chat, I wonder what we'd say? 

<|endoftext|>

You and I, we have the same blood through our veins, And the same veins through our foreheads. Living there, in the hollowed-out spaces between your vein and mine, I became versed in the art of becoming transparent. 
Slipping through wooden doorways dented and splintered by fury, Stepping delicately over minefields hidden under plush carpets of kindred smiles, My silent rhythms were tuned to those syncopated beats that punctuated your tired tin can symphony of expectations. 
In that place, I carved my comforts from the gaps between our matching picket-fence-teeth, and enclosed myself behind thick, sturdy walls built from borrowed bricks of wry laughter. 
Now, when my lover asks me why I love her so quietly, I want to whisper to her: When eggshells are your floorboards, you learn to lighten your bones.

Modern poems shouldn’t rhyme. They never flow. There’s never time To craft a verse that speaks in song, It doesn’t work, and just sounds wrong. Metered beats that count the bars, And meeting measures, counting stars, That stain the page in inky blots, A sky of commas, words, full stops. See - modern poems shouldn’t rhyme, They feel pushed, and every line, Will scream a scene of forced allure, That readers seem to deem a chore. So when you write, just keep in mind; If modern poems shouldn’t rhyme, That it’s your verse, and it’s your ink, So fuck what other people think.

crumpled receipts clutter the floor like daisies on a forgotten tombstone, an empty, purple crown royal bag sitting velvety and deflated as a lung. 
Cigarettes pack the cupholder into a marlboro-ed honeycomb, the streamlined winds of our commute rousing gray hives from his mouth. 
He speaks with a voice like faulty brakes, with a tone as rough and broken as steel atrophied with rust. He knows nothing of stopping, nothing of the finality 
of a destination. For even as he reaches where he's going, the engine in his chest too broken or inconvenient to repair shudders its futile rhythms, sputtering to start 
in its two-beat cries, never for itself knowing quite how it's been scooped out of its journey, or how one can become so lost in someone only to become lost by someone.

He turns me on, but doesn't touch me. I clean to keep myself preoccupied. 
On rare occasion, He allows me nearby. I long for his attention. He ignores me. I clean to keep myself preoccupied. 
It seems I love too much. He locks me away in a room. I clean to keep myself preoccupied. 
He left the door open. Maybe I should leave? Maybe He wants me to? He's told me it's not for me. I shouldn't. I clean to keep myself preoccupied. 
The door again? He must want me to leave. I'm outside! The grass! The trees! It's too much. Sensory overload. I call out to him. 
He picks me up. He carries me inside. And then again, He turns me on, but doesn't touch me. I clean to keep myself preoccupied. 
A story of my runaway Roomba 

<|endoftext|>

If I seem hungry and tired and alone, Forgive me, it's only because I am. 
If my eyes wander from face to face Like two stray cats, nocturnal and wild, Slinking through dark alleyways, Restless sovereigns of now and yesterday (For both are their domain), Forgive me. 
And if my mind jumps from word to word Like so many rats in an opening cage— A weltering discord of desperate rage, Drowning in its own tumultous depths (And there's no dignity. And there's no pride. 
And there's no easy answer. And it will never stop.) —Please, forgive me, 
For I am tired and hungry and alone.

I am a rose. Everyone already knows about my hips, so sweet. Everyone already knows about my thorns, so mean. 
But why is it that only poems about trees talk about their roots when mine run so damn deep? 
Is it because I do not shade you with leaves, Is it because you can't hang a tire-swing in me? Or is it because you cut me from my roots, and use me to cover your god damn sheets? 
No. It is because you experience me so passingly. You found me on the side of the streets, And don't even have the decency to pay me any mind once I'm free from those god damn sheets. 
I am more than the streets, I am more than you see I am more than my thorns and more than my hips and more than whatever feeling you thought you 
felt from my lips. My Roots. Run. Deep. 

<|endoftext|>

We ran across rooftops one night and kissed on the edge; we stood above the world, watching the people below as their lives passed before us – how easily they could see us, skin exposed, lips touching, but no one ever looks up; and somewhere between touching the sky and falling into your bed, you said, “You’re fun,” And I don’t know what that means – In fact, I have it on good authority that I’m not. 
At age six, A.J. calls me “goody-two-shoes” because I’m afraid of getting caught out of class. At eight, I learn what it means to be a “stand-in friend” when my sister isn’t around to play, and at thirteen, Brittany’s trying to hand me pills that she found on the street and telling me that I’m not fun like my sister. She would have taken them. She’s not afraid. 
I’m thirteen, and I learn to stay inside because around here men drive around with their pants down and girls disappear in the middle of the day – found later weighing five pounds less from loss of dignity. 
I’m thirteen, and I’m always home, because I think that I can somehow tether my sister and my mother to our apartment, to me, if I can cook and clean and keep everyone safe. 
I’m thirteen, and older guys come and go from our home, like it’s theirs, like my sister is theirs, and it’s like their belts are always undone, their faces always hungry, and when I try to make them leave they burn me 
with their cigarettes; bang on the doors and rattle the windows. And they’re laughing and yelling and I’m standing in the middle of the room with my hands pressed against my ears counting the different ways to die. 
I’m thirteen, and my sister is missing. My mother sits at home watching television, and I’m searching the neighborhood with a girl and her grandmother. 
She’s fourteen, and we find her outside the house of the boy whose brand is still fresh on my thigh, and she’s surrounded by men – Big men Tall men Older men Drinking and laughing men 
My sister falls on me, and I realize that I can’t hear anything. Their faces all blurred into one giant portrait of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught, and someone needs to remind me to walk. 
She’s fourteen and describing the things that he made her do to his dick. She’s fourteen and her eyes are rolling back into her head. She’s fourteen and the EMTs have to put her on a stretcher because she can’t stand. 
and somewhere in the background my mother is stopping her boyfriend from going over there to kill someone; and maybe she’s right; and maybe I’m the one who’s crazy, but what kind of mother says, 
“No. Don’t hurt the man who raped my baby.” 
My kind of mother protects rapists. My kind of mother always puts the man first. And my kind of mother has plenty of experience 
because for years she shielded my father from view hovering above us like a dark cloud while he raped me again and again. 
My kind of mother sends children out alone into a world where it’s too dangerous to borrow sugar from your neighbor, and when we come back bruised and broken, she tells us to sit down and shut up or she’ll give us something to cry about. 
For my kind of mother, this is just another thing she has to deal with. 
And when at sixteen, I told her that Eric had molested me, my kind of mother invited him to stay in our home and told him he was like a son to her. 
So I learned to say, “yes,” when I’m scared and violence is the only other answer, to say, “yes,” when they need me, when they want me, when I have to, to say, “yes,” least of all, when I want to. 
When you say I’m fun, I don’t know what you mean, but I hope it means you like me, that I pleased you. I hope it means I’m safe, but if you don’t call me tomorrow or next week – If you don’t call me again, that’s okay, because somewhere inside me, I’m still just afraid of the bad things that happen to little girls when they get caught.

You’re a bit like an Afghan hound, With swan bones And big milky green moon eyes. Your smile’s much bigger Than your face, Much bigger than The joke that’s just been told, Much bigger than The room that Tries to contain it. Your beauty is terrifying. One night, I explained it to you As “AAHH!” You said “What do you mean ‘aahh’?” “I mean, AAAHHH! You’re so ineffably gorgeous That I have to hide, Or drink, Until I find the confidence”. My lips and teeth Are quite small for my head, But they matched yours Like a finger In a plug socket And I was thrown Twelve foot across the room, To fizzle In a smitten heap By the door. 

<|endoftext|>

can’t you 
hear that? 
the trees stopped making air. I swear they are plotting 
to kill all of us who have been 
breathing since the minute we grew opposable 
thumbs and big 
spongy know-it-all brains filled with 
no-good stories and plans to build great towers to surmount the heavens. 
I heard them talking about it 
deep inside central 
park, while joggers flew past and old men sat on cold 
benches clutching today’s paper, the pigeons 
discussed the ethical implications. 
I don’t know if you noticed but I swear the squirrels are forming 
armies against us. I mean what could they be trying to hide? 
Surely you’ve seen them right? 
crawling about real low to the ground, always chittering about something while darting 
up the bare backs of oak trees. 
You believe me right? 
The walls of heaven are thin 
as plywood, and that goddamn landlord way up above 
is debating about turning off the electricity. as if the sun was some incandescent 
bulb, and he wants to throw 
it all out for one of those newfangled fluorescent ones.

and the moon would throw her shoulders back 
with eyes like unripe honey dew, offering 
a silver ring wrapped around her 
finger like patina ivy to the brick-jaw marketman, 
gesturing towards a clutch of cherries. 
but he would lay his hand across the counter 
and ask only to dance until the tide was low.

The universe says “expand”, But I cannot fathom building a legacy so disproportionate to the cosmos, That would take another mere hundred years to dissipate. 
I want to occupy no space at all, Tuck each tenuous limb inwards, And slip into a vacuum Before the reverberation of my heartbeat tunnels into consciousness – “You are still here”. 
Each thought, deafening, Taunts me, Sprouting outstretched appendages and eyes of obsidian craters, Pantomiming sluggishly in reverse, Like unhinged clowns underwater. 
“Collapse, collapse, collapse”, They command, With urgency that puts the universe to shame. 

<|endoftext|>

When I touched her She melted. And I poured her clarity Into a long necked vase, Put it on the windowsill, and Waited for the light to come through. Because when it hit just right She became infinite colour And our molecules would dance Through the living room and into the kitchen. I would soak up the energy And wring myself out at the sink. I would watch every drop circle down the drain And then wait, For the light to come back.

I'll just have to accept, that when I turn twenty My life won't be like a Miles Teller film I won't fall in love with someone who'll magically turn around every single problem and fix them. 
I won't go on crazy week long benders with friends because nobody actually does that We go to the same club every weekend and we think that we're happy with it but i'm not. 
I smoke out my window at 3am and say this is it, what I'm meant to be doing because I saw it in a film so its okay but its just a false reality it's not ok. 
But I'll still sit in bed at night and watch those movies and for two hours forget that my 20s will never be what I was told they would be.

My room has four walls, a fridge, a desk a kitchenette, and I know every inch of it; have examined every blade of carpet under my microscope, looking for the secrets these walls hold; taking notes on roughness, glue, weave, the way the brush flows like a detective, interpolating history, me whispering: carpet, carpet, speak please, carpet, speak to me left ear to the ground, right cheek facing heaven the smell of blood, hallucinated –– I am miles from the earth but still it hums just like a UFO. We sit together, silence like mortar; once, room, I begged you would talk.

The trees are about to show The ease of letting go 
But I don't know I don't know I don't know

In darkness, coal red eyes and wisps of fire, Beckon me, in cloistered caverns to thy coil, To snort and suck the scent of scaled desire, A claw’d touch, to welcome and recoil. O my dearest darkest wyrm of lust, My hemipenes prongs with quivered need, Your cloaca moist and ready for my thrust, Your fiery innards open for my seed. And scintillating spirals summon me, To mount the winged toothy maid of flame, I bite! Your supple neck writhes in glad agony Our love a conflagration of our names! And spent, release my grip, and humbly beg, Good lady, let us consecrate this egg. 

<|endoftext|>

i'll do whatever it takes i will not imagine you naked tonight 
i'll lick the earth and kiss a cloud i'll take a breath and wander the depths of my mind i will not imagine you naked tonight 
i'll find a church and fold my skin i'll wear the black and think of love as a type of sin i will not imagine you naked tonight 
i’ll smoke a spliff and swim in rum i'll snort a line and dance and sing and strum i will not imagine you naked tonight 
i'll touch myself watching a foreign film i'll hit the bar and fuck all the men and will not imagine you naked as I do i won't i just won't i won't i just won't I want, I just want. I want nothing more than you naked in my bed tonight.

Today I tried making oatmeal for the first time in the microwave and it came out tasting like sawdust and mediocrity. 
Yesterday I went to the beach with a coffee and a cigarette and hoped dark waves would swallow up this apathy. 
Honestly, Captain Ahab had nothing to complain about because he lost a leg but at least he could wake up and tell himself "yes, I am looking for something and it is colossal and great" 
and I bet he never pondered over novels from 167 years ago or if the way he answered the lady at the grocery store was too mean or the long silence between this moment and the next. 

<|endoftext|>

I think back to what we had and smile; you were a perfect being that came to rest on my sullen bones a while, being with you made me hone my good nature, condemn my burdens to the past, and while the sadness is ever present I choose not to resent how it ended, or that it did at all: to have merely been a page in your story was enough.

This one is for the children whose parents pay my mother to listen to their kids talk for an hour or so each week; You get more of my mother in one session than I have received in twenty years. Did you know that having my mother listen to your feelings for an hour each week is a gift that I never recieved? Did you know that when I was having issues my mother didn't ask me how I felt or ask me to talk to her about what I was going through, no. Her reaction was to send me to some stranger (a student from her school) to practice on me for a discounted price. And, now, she is getting paid to care about you . Which leads me to wonder that, maybe, if I had paid for her time maybe my mother would have listened to me too. To the children who get more attention from my mother than I ever dared ask for where were you during the divorce that almost happened? Because I was there feeling every heartache with you, Mom! Crying at a forever tainted Dairy Queen that you brought me to, trying to soften the harsh blow of the ugly word “divorce”, with a guilty offering of ice cream. I brought that Blizzard home with me, uneaten, and (after weeks) threw it in the trash yet the cold lingered in my heart and in our house for years. To the children who see my mother every week; Where were you when my mother was sad? Because I was always there, and Mom? You were always sad. 
And I always listened to you So why couldn’t you just listen to me Mom? You once told me you door was always open but it was only open on your terms. Only if I acted like the perfect daughter that I never managed to be. Your door was shut to the real me. To the children whose parents pay my mother to listen to their kids feelings for an hour or so every week; I wonder, do your parents listen to you?

I said "Fine. But not the regular kind of fine. The kind of fine that feels like an over-worn knitted sweater meeting a stubborn splintered desk corner, unraveling wildly against the tug of not doing enough, not saying enough, not trying enough, not listening enough, not being enough-- or the kind of fine that feels like two searing knives dipped in poison playing tic-tac-toe on your chest except no one ever wins or loses or cares or tries or listens and everything hurts and nothing hurts and it's all fine--really fine. The kind of fine that wakes you up at 3:09AM smelling like thick smoke and burning wood as it billows underneath your bedroom door but you're on the second level of your stepdad's house and you're too scared to jump so all there's left to do is panic or cry or suffocate or open the window and yell for help but no one is coming so you attempt to calm yourself by thinking of other things like if fine were a color it would look like an electric orange sunset you know, the ones that distract fine drivers and send fine ten- wheeled trucks off the sides of fine bridges."

my lighter stopped working today, exhausted by its own tiny passions the crick of the metal wheel sounding more like sea lacquered coast than a precursor to flame, more like scraping bow than a violin's melody, more like futility than warmth. 
i guess i had gotten used to being able to show my emotions without inhibition, of being able to bear the little light of my heart with the sudden and genuine intensity that so often paints youth in the brightest colors. 
maybe it's just the result of a passing of time, unavoidable and natural. 
but for all that i am i can't stop thumbing the metal teeth, hoping in the most human way that something can come out of nothing.

I killed a mouse. I did not realize it was a mother. A few minutes later I found four baby mice tucked away in an old rag I used to dry off my car last summer. 
Don't worry, they couldn't watch her die. Mother never got to pry open their eyes, so this bunch of baby mice with baby bliss never had to worry about eyes. 
My mind has a black fog, I don't know what it's called but I pray that it's not called "me" It has a death grip on my brain that needs pried loose. 
I don't want to live in my congested brain. I want to live but only in the hot lava on my chest from long ago, many months ago, when I'd walk under loud maple trees, feeling the orange and feeling the breeze, just thinking of ways to be the best man I can be for her, and perhaps even myself. 
I want to live but only if I find a new nightmare that doesn't just zoom closer and closer into that impenetrable wall of soaking brunette hair that I playfully flipped, grapevining her damn beautiful face that she hated. 
If I had found these four hopeless mice last August I'd have gently pressed a warm and wet Q-tip against their bloated bits to mimic the tongue of their mother. Baby mice need to shit and piss, that's how mother mouse gets her babies to shit and piss and live. 
But it's not August, there's no lava on my chest. It's time to ditch eraser-sized rodents in the woods, but I'm too busy. 
My lava left me and let me down but so did the rope. It did the ropedy-dope and broke, branding a brush-burn into my neck that spoke to me like Anne Sullivan, but in the language of burning skin instead of water and vibrations. The muscles in my neck turned acoustic and my burning skin told me that if I try to kill myself again to just forget about it, I don't deserve to live. Not for myself, not even for her damn beautiful face that she wasted. 
The black fog had a death grip. I pried it loose, put it in a balloon with baby mice, filled the balloon with helium then let go.

They weren’t the lights of a kind car, of nice people who wanted to swim, too. Who also thought it was wonderful to be naked in August and kind of drunk and kind of ruining a cigarette because there’s nowhere to dry your fingers 
And they don’t know the distinct and irrepressible grin that comes from water being pitch black and black-cold and thinking it’s kind of wonderful, kind of empowering, that if, god forbid, something did happen: - your limbs froze up - - or you became disoriented and drifted from shore- there would be no scene, no hubbub, no crush of lights and sounds, just the soft nonsense-babbles of the water And the gentle hum of August.

The easy answer is You don’t. 
An addict lives with a God shaped hole 
Deep within their chest, And you can’t fill it. 
You’ll try And try and try To be enough, 
But you’re not God. 
And as you fail, Relapse, The big “R” word, Will hang over your heads Like carrion crows 
As they circle And dive, You can bat them Away With frail hands. 
To the addict You might even Seem To fit the mold, 
But you’re not God. 
So how do you Save An addict? 
The hard answer is You don’t. 
You let them Go. 
To find what Fills the hole Completely.

And I don’t know What to do - Light another Bed-bound smoke Gasping we

I was kissing you and your lips tasted like velvet, our tongues red carpets into each other, our saliva divas strutting gorgeously, famously, furiously, I wish I could carve your name into the sky with an emerald pen. 
I close my eyes and picture your smile, teeth like gemstones or glass artifacts, are you my windows-tinted curious-pyramid Louvre? 
I can’t stop exploring you, walking around the rooms tucked behind your ears, the dimmed theaters beneath your breasts, kissing around your belly button, drain your body, dig into you, light nips on your throat like a fully-maned untamed lion. 
You’re miles away but you’re right next to me, training wheels off and maybe I didn’t know love until you hung yourself on me, soaking wet towel, sopped up sweat, displayed on a volleyball net. 
Are we teachers to the people we love? or are we just angels, biblical, euphoric, tastebuds drenched in the warm light of halos, legs wrapped around my back, I call you monkey, bear cubs playing, tearing my shirt off in the car. 
Now you’re peppermint poundcake, fluffy and soft like freshly picked daisies in the spring, I want to whisper that I love you, but you’re asleep, I won’t hang up the phone because time is precious, so I’ll write you a poem instead just to figure out the right way to explain that when I look at you I see a blanket by a hearthstone. 

<|endoftext|>

I didn't decide to smile today. 
I woke up and my bones creaked like Frogs in a pond, And my mind was still full Of weeds from yesterday And you had already left. 
I heard laughter outside So I got up and parted the window shutters With my fingers And let some yellow in-- 
You were sitting in the garden With your eyes closed Our daughter was laughing and Putting lilies in your hair, Her hands were covered with mud And you pretended Not to notice And something bad inside me Went away. 
I didn't decide to smile today. 
I just let it Hang that way.

I went for a walk up the hill And watched the birds Make abstract paintings, Or toddlers drawings, 
It’s hard to be sure. 
The grass was calligraphy across the barreling hills And the shit I stepped in Made me think of bloody mary’s 
With too much Lee & Perrins - 
Above, the mercury swirl Of swollen cotton buds Was good enough to take My mind off the rumset 
Happening to crack through. 
And I thought I saw this tree Pour the other a drink, spill vodka all over his branch, then apologise for being drunk.

First, you must let yourself be swallowed by her You must listen to the way she digests you You must watch the cold gear of a tired jaw grind you to stardust You must taste the things she tastes And smell the things she smells You must feel yourself become her if you wish to love her Second, you must navigate her You must become the cartographer of her hips You must name every hair You must know every scar and blemish like a captain knows his shore Understand all the ways you fit into her arms You must memorize her from rocky coast to rocky coast if you wish to love her Third, you must bleed for her You must let every one of her bruises bruise you instead You must drown in your own tears just to keep her cheeks dry You must kneel to her on broken glass Become her knight You must be willing to give your soul to know she’ll never have to give hers if you wish to love her Fourth, you must kiss her You must feel the salt of her skin between your cheeks with every breath You must bind her like a captive in your lips You must make time to just Kiss her Kiss her like she’s the last person you’ll ever see You must make her your favorite flavor if you wish to love her Fifth, you must hear her You must make your cheeks curl like hers when she recounts her wild tales You must welcome her into your ears like your favorite song You must hum the contours of her voice as you float between her spaces Feel the bass drum of her heartbeat You must dance to her breath if you wish to love her 
To write a love poem for her You must write with the words she taught you You must speak in tongues You must spell it out in the colors of her eyes In the long hugs that mean only themselves You must be fluent in her if you wish to love her If you wish to write a love poem You must first fall in love with her And by then You’ll have already done it

When a star collapses within itself, the destruction is undeniable and cruel. 
The planet-encrusted shrapnel slams in between the lungs of the bystanders with their emerald breastplates and the ashes of their parents tucked in between their toes so that if they perish. they won’t die alone. 
As the universe let out a heaving sigh of surrender, I looked at you up on your Jupiter throne and wondered if you helped create this universe for the sake of destroying it. Your crown was made of a rose-gold only obtained down in marthart. It was studded with diamonds that looked like daisies that you plucked from the bushes outside your castle. 
I presented you a sword and as i tore it from its sheath I nicked an artery just below your hip and I didn’t notice as the blood flooded the kitchen like you were Noah and the world was your arc. I could see the domino-effect of explosions encircling your pupils, the yellow sundresses were replaced with black trench coats; you didn’t want anyone to see the red. 
I traveled in my orange space ship to retrieve what ever I had decided would fulfill you that day, losing sleep to a harsh reality of 6 am wake ups and 2 am studying sessions. 
I approached the throne when it became clear the apocalypse had a strong chance of obliterating the universe we so carefully crafted while we chipped our nails and you scratched your neck. I always thought we were satisfied with the end result, but i’ve discovered humans aren’t simple. 
I asked you with my voice like Neptune, 
When you held him, did you feel me? In the royal bed, lying on the pillow I cradled you on when your kingdom faced revolt, did you love him like you loved me? Did you explore him like how you explored me? Did you know every mark on his body? did you know him like you knew me? Did he make you feel safe? Did he make you feel fulfilled? 
Your tears slid down my wrist like morning dew and as I raised my voice I wondered where we’d gone. 
As you shuddered behind your maroon gown, I wondered where the hope had gone, where the laughter had gone. 
As the stars popped like balloons around us, I wondered where I’d go next. 
As our creation destroyed itself from the inside out, I looked at you and I saw a stranger, a parasite controlling the person I so desperately fought for, and as I wielded my sword for one final fight, I couldn’t help but wonder, 
Was it worth it?

Seijogakuenmae In this sea of human flesh I imagine as if I were A desolate man adrift: Waiting in vain for tomorrow To be saved, for tomorrow to die. 
Hope you false Goddess! 
Did you hear? It comes. Will this be the one that takes me? 
How many bodies share with me This train - this damned path? How many live alone? How many share my destination? 
Did you hear? It comes. Will this be the one that takes me? 
This moment belongs to me: As if the rotting space Beneath a dead leaf Could ever belong to it. 
Did you hear? It comes.

If my body is a temple 
Then I'm a shitty tenant 
Bonfires in the living room 
House parties every other minute 
Blatant disregard 
As all the walls grow cracked and charred 
Foundation down to rubble 
The hardwood floor is chipped and scarred 
Outside it's always pouring rain 
The ceiling sighs and sinks with leaks 
Angry letters to the architect 
That I may never meet 

My father said to me, 
on my 16th birthday my father said to me: “I killed a man for calling your mom a bitch.” 
That was a lie. 
My father explained to me, “I didn’t actually kill him, I had your cousin Eddy kill him, he owed me a favor” 
My father had no punchline. there was no laughter. 
My father hugs me twice every time I leave home, because he’ll miss me double 
My father had to get on antidepressants when I moved out at 16 because my disregard for his feelings sent him into a depressive state He calls them his “dont kill people pills” 
I cried, I cry 
My father said this was done because you don’t let anyone disrespect your family. 
My Father says there is a war on christmas. He says Merry Christmas in July. He says Xmas is attacking his beliefs and taking the christ out of christmas 
My Father disowned me when I was 26, on christmas for being liberal 
My father took the son out of family 
My father took my best friend and I to the zoo when we were 6 because Bobby wanted to see penguins before he died. 
My father took me to the funeral when Bobby died later that month from Cancer 
My father gave a homeless man $1,000 and turned to me and said, treat everyone with dignity, then turned to the man and said “you’ll be fine” 
My father says racism was eradicated until Obama became president. 
My father calls every black man “N-word Ned” But he uses a hard R 
My father taught me that if someone hurts you, don’t let them see you cry, just make sure that you eventually make them cry 
My father beat me with a belt when I called him a hypocrite 
I cry, I cried 
My Father said that I represent him, that I represent my families name. 
My father slapped my mother once after she slapped him My father said “don’t hit like a man if you don’t want to be hit like a man” 
I see parts of him in me, half my best parts. 
I wake up every day scared that I also got his bad parts. 
On the other hand 
My mother said to me: I love you 
I’m not afraid of her bad parts 
She cries when I cry

Harvest moonlight for howling wolves mourning the ending night. Daylight buries darkness until darkness buries daylight. Night ending the mourning. Wolves howling for moonlight harvest. 

Small talk about the holidays new year, new you maybe you'll go paleo— there's no way out of this room 
Small talk about the weather mudslides and ice patches maybe you'll buy new boots— there's no way out of this exchange 
Small talk about the community the alderman is up for re-election maybe you'll remember to vote— there's no way out of this moment 
Small talk about the neighbors always screaming and banging maybe you'll call the cops later— there's no way out of this script 
If I could I would fold myself up slip through the walls and disappear forever but you're here, talking at my face with the expectation of geniality so just give me a moment to think up some bullshit just give me a moment to breathe.

I always loved you most in the morning; unbroken filaments of sunshine crawling in your amber eyes. And as you lay there reposed, basked in tomorrow's ruddy glow, I felt frozen as the sun languidly rose. 
I always loved you most in the morning; so unkempt and disheveled, all natural and freckled. And as I lay there exposed, unwrapped to the tip of my toes, I knew that you'd never know. 

The visage of thy parmesan in bloom; 
The blush of pepperoni dimpled cheeks 
Which spells for my cholesterol a doom 
For I am far too cheesy, far too meek. 
For thou art that which lovers never know; 
The unabiding, humble love of sauce 
Which, though it burns my tastebuds molten so, 
Does never cease to tempt with greasy gloss. 
Oh Pizza! Domino's or Papa Johns 
The pseudonym you wear I do not care 
For thou art bright the star I wish upon 
(And eat, soon after thirty minutes spared.) 
I am but lost in love for your soft cheese, 
Which more than carnal passion weakens knees. 

This is a poem about dinosaurs it's not a metaphorical kind of poem it's the kind of poem about literal dinosaurs 
This is a poem about how I drank myself into a coma one night and had a dream in which I acquired a book through thievery entirely dedicated to dinosaur poems 
This is a poem about those dinosaurs and how they wrecked things only because it pleased them and how people wrecked things only because they were terrified of wrecking things 
This is a poem about my daughter it's about me reading scary dinosaur poems to her and chasing her and making scary dinosaur noises and her laughing as she ran This is a poem about me trying not to wreck things

Who’d make molten lava with her eyes 
Burn admirers with a sharp exhale 
Drink the guts of wasps and bees 
And spit their stingers out at strangers 
I watched as she broke smiles and tarnished egos 
Howled loudly at well meaning men 
Felt all emotions between guilt and pique 
Yet rendered flesh from bone 
With a roll of her eyes 
We met 
I listened as 
She told dreams about liquid gold pouring from open mouths. 
And molten cats eyes diluted in champagne glasses 
I watched her live off the swish of dresses 
Spinning in an eternal dance 
And the frozen breath of wallflowers 
In the dark hallways of parties 
From my corner of the world I fell 
For the mirrored pools within her eyes 
And cartwheeled into unrequited lust 
Wasted in the sound of her exhale as she spoke 
‘not you’ and all descended into dust 

in the summer we were ghosts 
lonely lovers who only existed 
sometime in the space between 
midnight and sunrise 
sitting cross-legged in tennis courts 
or holding hands on park swings 
drifting in and out of 24-hour convenience stores 
sipping on slushies that made our kisses cold and blue 
in september 
we fell back into these earthly bodies 
felt the flesh of people deemed more real 
we stopped haunting an empty town 
and joined the crowd instead 
sometimes I wonder if we really happened at all. 

I know a girl who can paint with silence, 
Who radiates yellow, Champaign bubbling 
constellations in her glass. 
She glides: gossiping, glistening. 
Bottle never too empty, never too full. 
I know a girl who can paint with silence. 
She mirrors the pulsing blue; basking in the oceans 
muted roar. 
Dusk, may be her favourite colour. 
She left her sing song voice along with her high heel 
shoes. Sand now coarse, lit by darker hues. 
She asks simply, in a gorgeous grey, 
Why the brightest shades can never stay. 
I knew a girl who could paint with silence. 
Night now charcoal: echoing, hollowed. 
Like the pit of a stomach, 
Empty, but for pale pills swallowed. 
I knew a girl who could paint with violence. 
Face down bathing, 
Tub stained, 
Silence. 

when i traveled with you 
i hid the evidence 
no pictures allowed 
no social proof to be found 
just our lips 
slipped 
into a silent corner 
so when your story shows 
a lighter shade of blonde 
traveling with you 
to lips beyond 
i get it -- 
you're an exhibitionist 
i'm a voyeur 

what do bad postmen and this verse have in common? 

<|endoftext|>

i have never had your courage. i hide myself behind a microphone and leave all the darkness onstage abandoned as i retake my seat and blend back in with the crowd i have so much effort and medication and hope into becoming normal. 
but you scream your brokenness from the rooftops of reputation and i wish with every breath that my voice carried that far that i could ache like you without breaking character. 
and if you ever start to believe i am becoming sick of your scars that i do not wish you the world at your chipped-nail fingertips read this poem and remember i have been trying to control the envy taking root.

and he shouldn't, after all 
when the first thing i learned about 
L-O-V-E 
is that it tastes so much like 
L-I-A-R 
when he bites it out of my tongue 
and because 
the first boy that pressed his lips against mine 
would only write I love you 
in bruises 
so I'm still learning 
how to hold someone 
softly. 
he says I'm keeping secrets 
Secrets 
are the only way I got out of the house 
Secrets 
are hands shaking in the bathroom 
can't do eyeliner but I know my way around 
concealer 
apologizing for existing 
fuck you lying slut 
i know youre fucking him 
i know youre 
comehere 
Secrets 
i don't know how to love you without teeth 
i don't know how to kiss you without a knife 
lovingtasteslikehurting 
i never wanted to hurt you 
i never wanted to 
love you 
no one will love you like i do 
some days i believe them 
i hope you find someone 
and you love each other 
painlessly 
and you never believe 
in anything less 

oh but i do a lot to forget him. i kiss boys that i don’t know because they taste of cigarette like him. i do a lot worse than kiss because i don’t want the last person to be in me to be him. but he always is. he’s always in me. when i buy my groceries at 2pm, when i gag over the toilet at 3am. he’s all i know. 
it’s ironic, really. i wish i drank to forget him, but in incoherence it stands the same that all i can think about is him. when the party draws in and my world is spinning his name flashes like a broadway show on the front page of my mind. when it’s the middle of the night and i’m emptying the poisonous contents of my stomach, i see our past in the remnants. my pupils are dilated to hell and i can see his face in the black. 
if i’m drinking to forget him, it’s not working. how do you forget someone who became a part of you? someone who became the oxygen you breathe, the liquid in your bloodstream?

I swear you didn't even notice the day that the whistles and cat calls faded, became background static, because you have always been too goddamn polite. 
I promised myself I would not be defined by the amount of times someone elses hands met with my once-withered body I will not care whether or not he misses me when he is alone at night. 
But the first time a man grabbed me by the hair and called me a slut, No, I did not run I stayed for 2 years and called it love Until the day I just couldn't keep the blood inside my wrists anymore, No, he did not want to clean up this mess. 

A year of first times skill building apprentices of love and body 
every night the telephone rings and I hear him reaching for me as if his arms could extend right through the phone lines and land on the curve of my hip. 
but tonight his voice is small and reaching for himself instead of me because he needs to be held more than he needs to hold someone 
I’m asking inquiring demanding to know who has stolen my loved one’s voice. 
sympathetic tears run from my eyes like waterfalls when I hear him hiccup and choke 
moments millenniums 
“wou- would you still.. still love me.. if I told you I wanted-” 
hiccup. “wa-wanted to be” 
hiccup. 
“a girl sometimes.” 
The last piece of the puzzle leaves dry lips like the quiet squeak of a mouse. But my love is yelling, wailing, chattering pleading 
“Of course.” I say, without thinking about, the nothing there is to think about 
skeptical reallys why’s how’s 
utterances of wanting needing wishing normal 
days later clothes on my floor like a mountain kilimanjaro everest makalu 
closet door ajar half empty and rivers of light flow from under the bathroom door make up is scattered over the top of my dresser blushes and lip gloss 
and concealer mascaras 
the doorknob turns. my love is wearing my sweater my favorite pair of jeans and a smile as large as Texas. 
there’s kisses on the napes of necks, tips of fingers, tops of heads and I catch a whiff of cotton candy and spearmint. 
i never want, that smile to stop blinding me. but we both know people are more like wolves than bunny rabbits, and I wish I could do more to stop them from devouring you. But for now, I hope I’m enough 
just to clean out the wounds. 

I With my vivacious verbs 
My profound nouns 
Wrote this poem with the singular intention 
Of inciting a chorus of “Oooh” and “Ahhh” 
As you scan the page 
I want to see your eyes ignite with wonder 
Swell with meaning 
Leak with sentiment 
After all, that’s why I wrote this poem 
Maybe when you finish reading 
You’ll look up 
Say something like, 
“I’ve never known this side of you.” 
Or 
“I’m so touched...” 
Or even better 
Maybe you’ll let the page fall from your hands 
And wordlessly sink into my arms 

<|endoftext|>

But you won’t do any of that 
No tears 
No swooning 
Because I didn’t show you this poem 
How could I? 
You’d just look at me with an empty smile 
“It’s nice.” you’d say as you hand the page back to me 
That’s what you do with every poem 
I ever wrote to impress you 

sets down a tray two drinks. 
I think: Dissolve me like sugar in your cracked ceramic mug stir me like we’re already past this part and drink me despite bitterness, (look I still keep the grounds left over from when I was cut down to make this thing sitting here, also sorry I'm not Brazilian) despite biting and burnt around the edges. But I do not say-- 
You sip. Eyebrows tense over steam. And maybe there is-- You shrug before leaving a dollar fifty and me.

it cost $14.63 to be picked up and driven to your hotel so we could have our date 
only there was no date there weren’t any drinks there was no dinner there was no conversation 
instead it cost $14.63 to be raped 
it cost $14.63 for you to shove your fingers your tongue your cock wherever you wanted them 
it cost $13.42 to be picked up and driven back to my apartment so i could think about what went wrong 
total i paid $28.05 for this experience 
i didn’t know rape had an exact price 

Tap tap flick. 
6:02 am, eyes crusted, dry mouth the cavern in my chest grows larger as the light saturates the bedroom and reflects a tired face on a smudged black screen. 
Tap tap flick. 
I don't know you Caitlin32, but your life is an exhibition and I'm just a greedy voyeur trying to fill a giant cavity with your perfect pastiche of placid domesticity. 
Tap tap flick. 
Gold watches, invisalign smiles your curated lifestyle content beams at me, like a radio transmitter set to crippling self loathing with the reverb of an envious pout. 
Tap tap flick. 
Drag myself out of bed, its time to feed the bullshit machine with artfully contoured cheeks and an empty family posed with tepid, day old Acai bowls— 
'God damnit Jeffery, I don't care if you're tired, you need to SMILE for the likes.'

Enamored with her fine silk thread, so quick the taste of blood does ebb; to spin, for her, is to forget the purpose of the web.

I was born with flower buds sprouting from my skull, Such silly pink things, They were almost mistaken for little tufts of newborn hair. I was a giggling mess, My flowers running wild, “What lovely flamingoes my darling has!” Is what my mother told people, at least. They would smile through glazed eyes, But even my tiny mind could see glaciers behind pupils, Grossly black voids drilled into their own heads. As I aged, I tended to a garden, Doves’ nests resting quietly in the blooming bushes. But people had come to smile less, Their eyes leaking shadows— I didn’t know that glares could kill a forest. One day, a boy spewed nothings into my face, But Nothing is a disturbing creature, And it was verbicide mutated into herbicide— I thought my flowers were beautiful, though! I drove violently down the road, Watching as petals littered my dashboard, I tried saving what I could, But my head might as well have been burned to ash. The only survivor of my garden’s apocalypse was a measly peony, Barely breathing with a smoker’s lung. I ripped her from my skull, And I have never felt such pain. I locked her into a cage, Because she wasn’t even pretty enough to press into a book. And now, I was a member of the hallowed ones, My once-earthy eyes were desolate, Dying, 
Probably dead. I was finally cast into a deserving winter. But even roses grow back after a sadly-sung tragedy, For it is the nature of nature itself, Yet I was naive enough to deny myself of light. “It takes time,” I whispered to myself, As I hesitantly unlocked my old friend’s cage, She didn’t deserve such a punishment. Seated atop my head again, She smiled in the sun, And I followed like a glowing mother, But we are both still children, Spring is just beginning, my dear. 

Summer runs and Winter tales fill my head with Thunderbirds and Nightingales. I am homesick in my own skin. 

You are the needle That weaved through me And the thread you left behind Now holds me together Against the crushing tide Of your absence 

Sun down and people up Ping-pong balls 
In fresh solo cups, Everyone's movin' And no one's lookin' (For an exit). 
Shitty silver in hand, Bass shakin' 
Bones, walls and Asses all around, A vision of sound. 
O! To dance, dance, dance Steppin' 'round 
In a crowd of chance Spinning forever Or 'til house closure. 
(Well I once did,) 
I once met a girl like you, Shimm'ring, I may 
Once again, too, Once for the month, Once is just enough. 
But tonight, steal light We twirl 'round 
While dreamers delight In quiet paradise, We vibe with vice 
(‘Til we have none). 
Well I once did, once met A girl like you 
After sun had set To silver on black-- Will you come back? 
O! I dance, dance, dance But don't mean 
For words to prance; When all's asleep I need none to keep 
(I'll soon be done)... 
'Cause I once met a girl Lookin' like 
You in mid-twirl, She spun and she spun, Gone at morning sun. 

$14.99 plucked fresh from the flour escence of the apathetic grocery store attendant taxed me for their beauty and i, fumbling in the rain for car keys slipped, red sodden petal drops weighing, peeling off the bud like the curl of the choleric lip that brought me here, but perhaps if i had shown her the same resi ndignation, i wouldn't be soaked to the spine, clutching at some bitter skeleton of thorns. 

i used to count our years apart like blades of grass but the field sprawled and now i must count them by their roots.

I lie awake at night makings lists of things I cannot be... 
I am not a dancer. But my heart? My heart doesn’t know that... It makes my feet tap each time they feel the rhythm of a song. It doesn’t know there’s need for longer feet and stronger arms. It doesn’t feel the extra weight, it doesn’t care the muscles hurt. My heart can’t rest until it matches every single note, Because all it knows is that my feet were meant to dance. 
I am not a painter. But my eyes? My eyes don’t know that... They think you catch beauty in your brush just by looking. They don’t know you paint with the heart, not with the hands. They don’t care you must feel much more and think much less. My eyes can’t hide their lust for all the beauty in the world, Because all they know is that my hands were meant to paint. 
I am not a writer. But my mind? My mind doesn’t know that... It makes my fingertips storm the keyboard at every thought. It doesn’t care of rhyme or structure, of classic tales and modern verse. It doesn’t see my words are much too empty and my stories way too thin. 
My mind can’t stop making up lines others have written before, Because all it knows is that my fingers were meant to write. 
I lie awake at night making lists of things I haven’t been, Counting every failure I had and all the trophies that I’ve missed, Marking each step I never took and every place I’ve never been, Gathering people I’ll never be and all the things I’ll never do. But my dreams? My dreams don’t know all that... Because I close my eyes and in my dreams I am a dancer and a painter and a poet.

We talked about ourselves - and trudged along the empty streets, as smudged stars bit our cheeks, but kindly and soft. And holding up our eyes aloft, the black wind glowed an orange-red. Our hands apart, fingers unwed. About a foot below our shoes, the cobbled ground slow-danced the blues. Although the sky was dry like dust, the streetlights’ burned with laser lust and showered down a chattering rain which soaked our skins like jazz champagne. When ground returns, the air is still, with fingers locked, then we’ll be us. 

It wasn't the first time a boy drove by me and called me that. But my shorts were rolled up tonight, to where my thighs were golden, stiff, aching and exposed. My eyes were tearing -- the light, laying over my hometown like a bison tired in the tall grass at day’s end, and Gay Angels playing on the teeth of a steel comb in my headphones. He was muscular in his white truck laying rubber. His eyes, full of love for his friend riding shotgun, were wild. My high school lust lost his opium partner to a commuter rail, the fury of a god unleashed on the body of a child. Tonight, I didn't want to scream back at him as he rolled on, or hold my dick and fill the inside of my shorts with his anger, and that felt like progress. 

I didn't become a man 
when I won my first fight 
I became a man 
The first time I lost 
I learned nothing from victory 
But failure taught me the cost 
I did not become a man 
From my fathers emotional abuse 
To this day 
The man has his excuse 
He'll tell you he toughened me up 
He never did 
Do not mistake for masculinity 
The hatred and violence that I hid 
I was not a man all the times I fantasized 
About punching him in the teeth 
I became a man when I forgave him 
He could only win 
If I became him underneath 
No manliness did I find 
In all those days I spent alone 
Isolated and brooding 
inside of my own home 
convinced no one could help me 
because i'd never let them try to set me free 
I became a man when I looked around 
and saw my family 
Little cousins might annoy a boy 
but a man is wise enough to know 
To love the noisy chaos 
and only kindness show 
I did not become wise 
With some intellectual master key 
Instead I became a student of life 
So much to learn and see 
I'm better now than I was last year 
Ten years from now i'll be better still 
And when i'm eighty I'll laugh at the young fools 
Calling me over the hill 
Kindness and ambition and humility 
I pray these be my trademarks 
Be wary of anyone who tells you 
That men must have dark hearts

Bars are like house parties for old people. I always hated house parties. And old people. 

The lights stop burning at the 29th hour. The sheep are mocking me. I hear nothing but the ticking, Ticking, Ticking Of the clock, And the whispers of the day gone: “Another one wasted” “Did you really show your best?” “Another day closer to --” The anxieties knot into an alarm I don’t know if they’re pulling me into them, Wrapped in the comfort That if I didn’t worry, I wouldn’t care Or pushing me out of my mind Because I’m not quite good enough there. 
The lights start burning at the 39th hour. Too bright, too bright to keep my eyes open, But too enticing to let them close. I want to find meaning in this. I want to find meaning in you. Have I lost sleep because you lost me, And you took that in trying to find me? The conversations that we lost Found their way back to me. Is it because you’re saying them again? Is it because they want to be heard? They’ll have to fade to a whisper though, Mum, because sleep and I have catching up to do. 
The mind starts wondering at the 49th hour. But time’s just a word for now. This is the hour of the soul, The flight into the wordless and thoughtless. Automaton, I don’t see with my eyes. I see stars at midday, shining, Glistening, 
Glazing the sky. Some are probably dead. I see the man the boy always wanted to become, Standing back-turned to the man he became. The terrible insight of the unbroken light, One day, maybe, I’ll see nothing. 

i mean really try to put yourself in my shoes. no no not your feet— your whole damn body. drain your blood and crush your bones if you must just jam yourself inside so i can knot the laces together, toss you in the air and string you from a power line. 
hear the electricity buzzing up there? what about the birds perched right above you? doesn’t the warm sweat building up between your body and the inside of my shoes just make you want to explode? rain down in globs of flesh onto the cars below? 
now thump onto their windshields and feel the automatic wipers scrape you off to the side 

You said I could do it. 
You were always the one who believed in me. 
Four years later, 
I was done with my English Degree. 
You shouldn't have said I could be an author. 
You should have told me to be a doctor. 
I studied language but couldn't come up with an answer, 
when you told me that you had cancer. 
Maybe if I went to medical school 
I wouldn't have felt like such a fool. 
If I was a doctor, 
I could have put in your I.V. 
Instead, all I did was write poetry. 
With this english degree, 
I cannot help anyone, not even me. 
If I was a doctor, 
I would have known what to do. 
With an english degree, 
I can only write about how much I miss you. 

she says, I miss the way we- my lips interrupt on hers and i whisper, so don't. 

addicting once I take a sip I only want more you make me feel things I’ve never felt sober you make me do things I’d never do sober 
happiness fleeting but certain I want you and crave you and hate you 
when I wake up with a hangover I swear I’ll never drink again but when Friday comes around I find you in my hands on my lips and in my head 

When I write for you I push the pen so hard against the paper It rips And I'm left feeling As if I'm only scratching the surface 

Liquids first, that's clever planning, In the face of frenzied scanning, Hands with cracked and faded polish Strive to dent and fling, demolished, 
All your goods like it's a race, The chequered flag? That tiny space That's barely fit to house a flea, Which quickly fills with packs of tea, 
And foreign fruits preserved in brine, Inexpensive German wines, Saw-blades, socks and radish jam, Frozen custard, legs of lamb, 
Curried crisps and loaves of rye, Easter eggs, a gin-soaked pie, Treadmills, snowboards, sacks of spices, Christmas trees at crazy prices! 
You steal a glance at the cashier, Your eyes all wide and full of fear, But they look down and carry on, Brain-dead, vague, automaton. 
Those behind you wear a frown, Because they know you've let them down, But soon their frowns will disappear: They'll share the fate, you've suffered here. 

We use such simple words to weave 
the tapestry of light into our language. Red. Yellow. Green. Blue. Black. White. 
But what is blue? Did Homer know when sailing on a wine-dark sea? Why did he paint the sky with bronze 
and layer green with honey? 
The ancient brain is not the new; 
when, with my modern eyes, I view the ocean and the midday sky 
they look, unquestionably, blue. 
With other simple words, we paint 
the colors that we feel. Sadness, joy, fear, hate, 
love: all these signs reveal 
some inner state. But what is love? 
How can we call that one emotion longing, ecstasy, respect, 
infatuation, and devotion? 
I grasp with these imperfect pigments, 
try to catch the palette of experience — and fail. What tint can be, unquestionably, love? 
My blue is not a simple sine, nor is my love Euclidean: no matter how I flatten it, 
my love’s oblique meridian 
will not lie on a paper map, nor nanometers ever be Pacific waves, a robin’s egg, 
or what a person meant to me. 
Just as the different shades of blue 
have secondary colors there, so love can be tinged green with lust 
or dyed in indigo despair 
and still be love. Love’s many things, 
and though its boundaries aren’t defined its subtle thread is intricately 
laced throughout the tender mind, 
intertwining feelings that, 
at first, might seem quite different within a tapestry of sense 
that weaves around love’s referent. 
In that tapestry, love cries 
while flying on blue swallow’s wings; it flowers pink in fruiting trees 
and runs with umber wild things. 
You’re in it, too, in faded fields 
of tangled thread, a knotted part (the untrained work of younger hands) 
whose weft still binds my heart. 
Our love may not have been for years, 
been made, at best, imperfectly, even at our hyperbolic 
orbits' heated perigree, 
and cast us both on fast and far 
trajectories to where we are: you, married to the gravity 
of some bright northern star, 
and me, to where I settled, bound 
with two firm feet on loving ground. But, sometimes — when I look on high — 
I see your color in the sky. 

11,000 (cups) near-boiling water 
3 (parts per million) chlorine 
1 (whole) nude man, cheeks pitted 
1 (whole) nude man, feathers plucked 
1 (whole) nude man, making silent promises to stay in the water until the meat slips off 
his bones— until the cartilage in his knuckles 
melts into the mixture and makes for a full hearty broth 
of naked body stew 

Thank you for taking the time from our day, to fill applications but lets keep it brief. I'd say you're exhausted, and don't mean to doubt, but the truth will be clear if your story checks out. 
You filled in neglectful dad, common but crucial, did rehab in church then OD'd on god, 
but you talk now, he's clean, yet loves god more than you? A heartwrenching try, still that answer won't do. 
Your mother, ah yes we see her here often, you must be the anchor she's all too fond of. Support can be rough, 
but you were 18 i'm told, and of course they're divorced that one really gets old. 
You say you self-harmed. Well that's always a must, 
but slashed wrists aren't legitimate, 
where else did you cut? Did you even once hide behind jackets or sleeves? Sir we don't sell attention, please don't lie to me. 
What's this- middle class? Why the hell are you here without child molestation or savage abuse? I'll have to reject this, you can stop with the threats. I'll prescribe a night's sympathy, 
but you just aren't depressed. 

It’s not the beer You haven’t poured it yet But I hear you singing Under your breath 
Just above the clanking Mom used to do dishes like that So I tune in as if That song will be the last 
Salvation I have Against any doubt But I don’t have the balls To ask a server out 
So let’s keep between us This bar and this glass Sing like my sweet mother I’ll keep coming back
