this is the first poem 
i hope you do not have high expectations for it 
it is just like all the other poems 
lowercase and sad 
i am lowercase and sad 
i should move to an island somewhere 
where happiness is outlawed 
and if you display external happiness you are shot in the town square 
and people watch and point and laugh 
but mirthlessly, because they do not want to be shot

turn the sink on high so the sound of the water can drown out the splashing sounds of your shit logs as they fall from your asshole and you can hide what you are doing even though shitting is a natural part of life and everyone does it even people like ellen page who are literally too cute to live yet somehow live anyway and your brain rationalizes this information but your hands are still sweaty after you wash them because you know your friend knows you were just ejecting shit from your asshole and in a way they are empowered by that knowledge and this makes you feel dirty/kind of broken

sometimes late at night i post facebook statuses about how sad i am in the hopes that people will reach out to me and ask me if i'm okay and i will tell them no and they will ask what's wrong and i will say i'm depressed and they will say just think positive and i will call them stupid and i will say depression does not work that way and i will get mad and i will block them on facebook and my friend count will go down by one

there is this little man in my chest cavity
he is wearing a little hardhat and has little workboots on
in his left hand he holds a little pickaxe 
his job is really simple
every day, multiple times a day
he takes his little pickaxe and chips away at my heart 
and a piece of my heart flakes off and lands by his feet
and he looks at it and then kicks it away into a giant pile of heart shavings
this has been going on for years
i really hope he's not a liberal arts major
one of these days he'll be unemployed

are you enjoying reading my poems?
i actually don't even know if they count as poems
maybe if i put in arbitrary enjambment 
and lots of pointless sensory descriptions
about trees
then i will be a real poet
i will buy a beret
and a macbook
and go to starbucks
and i will write poetry
and it will be poetic

i have this theory
i'm in the middle of a car crash
right now 
i'm seven years old
i'm coming back from florida
i'm in the passenger seat
and the car is swerving left
there is a truck coming towards us
the truck is not stopping
the car is not stopping
my eyes are closed
i am thinking hard
the giant hamster wheels in my brain are spinning really fast
in my head i am eighteen years old
i have no friends and no future prospects and i'm poor and feel inferior to everyone and my life is shit
i am writing a poetry collection to express how sad i am and to maybe come to terms with it and embark on the long process of self-acceptance and rehabilitation
i am opening my eyes
i am smiling 
the grille of the truck is smiling back
things could have been worse

today i wanted to ride my bike
so fast and so far
that the g-force would rip me out of my skin
peel me, like a banana 
and i would keep riding on as a grinning skeleton
and people would stare and mutter incredulously under their breath and go to work confused or maybe call in sick and go home and lie down on their couches and wonder if they were become senile or contracting some early form of dementia 
and eventually i would ride under a clothesline and acquire a new skin; a better one
i'd also bump my head on a low-hanging street lamp and my brain would fall out with a resigned squelch
and along the way i would pick up a new brain from a black market organ dealer in chicago
a smarter brain; one that is not broken like the old one
and i would keep riding my bike
tilting my head up at the sky every so often to scream joyously
because things were okay
and things were going to be okay
and i was going to be okay

<|endoftext|>

the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning
is the faint glimmer of hope that things will be better today
and that i will not be anxious
and i will not be depressed
i will be confident and strong and happy
i will finally live my life
every day i tell myself this
and every day i am disappointed 
i am such a fucking liar

my best friend yelled at me today
for doing drugs
stop that shit, he said
he typed it in all caps
so i knew it was very serious
he made me feel bad about myself 
which is ironic because that's exactly why i started doing drugs in the first place
to get a few hours of relief
from my inside voice
not happiness, exactly
just a lack of sadness
like a numbing of the heart
antifreeze in my chest
bitter and cold and slushy

<|endoftext|>

i decided to throw out all my drugs 
so i put them in a raisin box
and put my jacket on
and put my hood up
and felt very cool and movie-like
and snuck out to the hudson
and threw them in the river
and missed
and felt very dumb and unmovie-like
and they landed in the grass
and i looked for them
and it was very dark
and i could not find them
and i do not know where they are
and i am freaking out
and i am very scared
and i have no drugs to calm me down
and i will never sleep again
and someone will find my drugs
and i will go to jail
and i will lose my scholarship
and i will lose my anal virginity
why did i quit drugs?

<|endoftext|>

i want to get away from here
just up and leave one day
with a bag of clothes and some money
maybe a toothbrush, too
maybe not
i'll live dangerously 
buy a train ticket to anywhere
and not tell anyone where i'm going
and i'll wind up in a place where the pines grow free and strong
and i will grow free and strong
and start a new life
one i do not wish to leave

<|endoftext|>

i'm watching scooby-doo at four in the morning and
wondering where my life went wrong but
oh my god is that velma good lord i never
noticed how fucking joocy she is like those
thighs oh my god they kick 
up like untamed horses and my hand is 
moving on its own like it has a separate 
brain and i wish we could switch brains so i
might not be so sad like a horse in a 
stable that is waiting to die with his
best years behind him and he 
can't remember what they were and i
hope god is real so i can try this again and
maybe not fuck up so bad a second
time although for all i know this is the 
hundredth time i've been given a life and
squandered it so maybe i
deserve to live and die alone without
joy or pleasure in my
days and the sun is coming up soon but
i can't seem to fall asleep because i can't stop
worrying about where my life is and is not 
going so maybe I'll take a sleeping pill or forty and
ride the mystery machine on my way out like
jinkies

my brain and i do not get along
he is a leo while i am a taurus 
one night he wakes me up at 3 am
it is the middle of the night so i was dreaming
in my dream i was on a picnic with ellen page and she was laughing and i was laughing and then there were ants and the ants were screaming the word 'fuck'  repeatedly in tiny squeaky voices and then ellen started screaming the word 'fuck' repeatedly in a tiny squeaky voice
then i woke up and my brain was screaming the word 'fuck' in a very monotonous and half-heartedly drawn out way
it was going, 
'fuck'
just like that
i get up and drink a glass of water because my throat is dry like i'm staring down a thousand years of mondays
the water is cool and earnest as it trickles down my throat and lands somewhere behind my ribs
i am standing in my room with the lights off holding an empty glass of water in one hand
my brain is saying, 'you will live and die alone'

your smug face smugly smugging at me smuggingly 
chin so sharp you have to watch out when you look down 
so you don't stab yourself in the neck and bleed to death 
you’re like 
"guys look at my breasts" 
"i have breasts, see" 
"did you see my breasts" 
"p.s. i have breasts lol" 
"did you see them" 
"guys" 
"did you"
 "guys" 
breasts 
breasts 
breasts 
is that all you have going for you 
hey 
remember that time you wanted to fuck 
and i was the one who got fucked 
or that time you wanted to hang out 
and i missed doing college applications for you
or that time i wanted to talk 
and you were too busy being you 
or those times i needed a friend 
and you were too busy being someone else's 
because i do 
you've changed so much 
you are upstater than me 
you are a party girl 
you are having fun without me 
you don't think about me even though i think about you 
you have lots of new friends 
meanwhile i am lonely and scared and sad and i have no new friends 
i don't think we were ever friends 
i hope you get fatal amphetamine poisoning 
you cunt

wow
things got pretty dark there
so i want to lighten the mood
just for a little while
darks and lights, you know
that’s what bob ross said
now let's talk arizona tea
arizona rx energy herbal tonic is the best motherfucking one
i will shower in it one day
and it will enter me
through every orifice
and we will become one
i will fuse myself with the arizona rx energy herbal tonic
and all will be well with the world

<|endoftext|>

one day i will destroy the world from the inside-out with a giant robot arm that i will build myself in my mother's basement while subsisting on a diet entirely comprised of mountain dew and doritos and i will show you all who the fucking nerd is

one day a crab decided to enroll in a liberal arts college and the crab became a hipster crab and all his crab friends left him because they said he read too much and quoted passages from tao lin constantly

<|endoftext|>

if crabs could talk
what would they talk about
like
would they discuss crab things
like bob's shell not falling off yet
even though he's hit crab puberty
and has a really deep voice for a crab
and is having lots of crab sex
and is getting drunk at crab parties
and has started filling out his crab fafsa application
even though it's only july
and he still has some months to go?
i like crabs
crabs are nice

<|endoftext|>

i hope things will get better for us someday
me and you
happy
together
in the inarticulable future
please do not lose hope
